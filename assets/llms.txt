## DC20

The DC20 is a 4-Door Access Controller that is cloud-managed, secure by default, and built for enterprise scalability.The DC20 pairs seamlessly with Rhombus Access Control devices and existing door hardware.

![Screenshot 2024-03-20 at 10.35.02 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/25182419327117)

### Door Relays

The DC20 is equipped with six Form C relays with both Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC) contacts that can be used to control door locks and auxiliary devices.

Four of the relays can be used alongside four individually selectable 12VDC or 24VDC power supplies to control the power delivered to locking hardware. The maximum current per output is limited to 830mA at 12VDC and 415mA at 24VDC.

**Note:** Before powering the DC20, be sure to select the appropriate voltage \[12VDC\] or \[24VDC\] for your end device.

![Snip20230725_68.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/17932168135949)

### Inputs

The DC20 includes a single pair of the Request to Exit (REX) and Door Position Indicators (DPI) for each of the four doors available for the DC20. DC20 inputs are compatible with contact-type devices with a NO or NC state. To connect a device to the input, connect the two output wiresof the end device to the input. The default state (NO or NC) can be configured through the Rhombus App or Console.

![Snip20230725_67.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/17932168140685)

An auxiliary input labeled \[AUX\] can receive contact-type inputs from devices such as intercoms or intrusion alarm panels and trigger events created in the Rhombus Console.

### Door Readers

The DC20 comes with the ability to add four Wiegand readers and four RS-485 Readers (Rhombus or OSDP protocol readers).

**Note:** The DC20 can only operate four virtual doors at once. A virtual door can have more than one physical badge reader (Wiegand or RS-485 ports) associated with it but not more than one door relay.

#### **Wiegand**

The Wiegand terminals provided on the DC20 are Data Low (D0), Data High (D1), Terminals (OUT1) & (OUT2), Ground (GND), and 12VDC power. Power for the Wiegand reader is rated at 660mA each. Terminals (OUT1) & (OUT2) are configurable in Rhombus Console to support LEDs and buzzers.

#### ![Snip20230725_70.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/17932153446285)    **RS-485**

DC20 is compatible with Rhombus DR20 Reader, DR40 Video Reader, and certified third-party door readers using OSDP protocol over RS-485. The 12VDC power supplyin the “WIEGAND” section can be used for RS-485 readers and powered input devices up to 670 mA per output.

**Note:** The DC20 cannot supply power for the DR40. Power to the DR40 reader must be supplied using POE or a 12-28VDC external power source.

![Snip20230725_69.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/17932168147725)

**Remote Power:** If you choose to power an RS-485 reader via an external power source and not PoE, a ground wire must still be wired back to a \[GND\] terminal on the “RS-485” section of the DC20.

### Power

The DC20 comes with a 100-240VAC to12VDCpower adapter. The power cord is secured to the main board by a pluggable screw terminal. Once all other connections have been made and terminal contacts are screwed firmly in place, ensure the pluggable terminal end of the power adapter is connected before plugging the adapter’s power cord into a 100-240VACwall outlet.

### Tamper

An onboard accelerometer and proximity sensor will detect any significant movement of the DC20and the enclosurecover. A 2-position terminalis also available to connect an optional wired contact sensor.Movement detected by any of the 3 sensor types can be configured to generate an event in the Rhombus Console.Before powering up the DC20, ensure cables are not obstructing the view of the proximity sensor.

![Snip20230725_66.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/17932168149005)

### Ethernet

The DC20 supports 10/100BASE-TX ethernet. Use aCAT5 or CAT6 cable with an RJ45 connector. Plug an ethernet cable into the RJ45 jack.

![Snip20230725_65.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/17932153451917)

## Recommended Wiring

Wiring methods used shall be in accordance with the National Electrical Code, ANSI/NFPA 70. All wiring of the DC20 should be performed prior to connecting power. Power should be removed before attempting to service the DC20 or any of its connected devices. Below is a wire type and size for the types of terminals.

**Note:** We recommend that you consult with the appropriate federal, state, and local authorities for any relevant regulations at the time of installation.

## Video Retention

The duration of a camera's video retention depends on its model, the resolution and bitrate settings, the amount of motion it sees, and whether Cloud Archiving is enabled.

To find out how many days of onboard storage you may have, check the estimate provided in the "Camera Settings" section in the console.

![Screenshot 2025-01-02 at 3.56.48 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/33169555553549)

Figure 1.) A device's camera settings show an estimate of onboard storage days.

Cloud Archiving is sold by the day and will not be affected by the same variables as onboard storage. The best way to find out how much cloud archiving you have is to review the "Licenses & Features" section of your console settings.

![Screenshot 2025-01-02 at 4.00.46 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/33169673476877)

## Overview

Rhombus admins can add and delete users and partners to grant or revoke access to your organization's Rhombus devices. This article covers how to perform each of these actions.

## Add a User

In this section, we will go over how to add a Rhombus console user and a Rhombus Access Control user. A user can have access to both under the same user account.

- [Rhombus Console User](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001062232-Manage-Users#h_01HQ9F4Z6MCRHKHF2GZMDD76C2) \- A console user can see Rhombus devices (Cameras, Sensors, or Access Control) and all the videos or statuses associated with them. The Console user also has access to the Rhombus console mobile app.
- [Rhombus Access Control User](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001062232-Manage-Users#h_01HQ9FTDEC5SWJ8KXKS65JRS12) \- An access control user can have physical access to the site where Rhombus Access Control is deployed. Their access will be either a Mobile credential via the Rhombus Key App ( **Note:** This is a separate app from the Rhombus Console App) or a physical card.

### Console User

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Navigate to "Settings" and click "Manage Users." |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-05 at 3.27.32 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32469747483149) |
| 2\. Select "Add User." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-04-23 at 1.22.50 PM copy 2.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36073330409741) |
| 3\. Fill in the user information and select which type of access will be granted to the user. An email address is required for the Rhombus Key app and console access. Click "Next." |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-05 at 4.10.38 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32470522696973) |
| 4\. Click the dropdown menu to select a role for the user. Ensure "Send Welcome Email" is toggled on so the user receives the email to complete their account creation, and click "Create." |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-05 at 4.12.00 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32470522699661) |
| **Note:** You can also log into your existing [SSO provider](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000976332-Setting-up-SSO) for authentication and set up automatic user provisioning and de-provisioning by setting up SCIM. |

### Access Control User

Below are the steps to add an access control user to the Rhombus Console. An access control user can have physical access to the site where Rhombus Access Control is deployed. Their access will be either a Mobile credential via the Rhombus Key App ( **Note:** This is a separate app from the Rhombus Console App) or a physical card.

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Navigate to "Settings" and click "Manage Users." |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-05 at 3.27.32 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32469747483149) |
| 2\. Select "Add User." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-04-23 at 1.22.50 PM copy 2.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36073330409741) |
| 3\. Fill in the user information and select which type of access will be granted. An email address is required for the Rhombus Key app and console access. Click "Next."<br>**Note:** You can select "Access Control - via Card" and/or "Access Control - via Mobile App." These settings can always be added to an existing user if needed. [User Credentials for Rhombus Key App](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/22238114934029-Add-User-Credentials-for-Rhombus-Key-App#h_01HHDC83EQY8DNRJ76N77DEGCM) outlines this process in more detail. |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-05 at 4.21.20 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32472086675213) |
| 4\. Add the user to an existing group (this step is optional). Click "Next."<br>To learn more about groups, reference our article on [Creating a Group of Users for Access Control](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/18182583242509). |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 11.52.27 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32665469355149) |
| 5\. Toggle on the desired Access Control settings for the users, and input the physical card information if the user is being configured to use a Card. If using the Rhombus Key App, ensure the Welcome Email remains toggled on so the user can complete their account set up. This is not required if the user will be using a physical card only. <br>To learn more about physical credentials, go to [Registering a Key Card (Access Control Credentials)](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/17767106440205-Registering-a-Key-Card-Access-Control-Credentials), and to learn more about mobile credentials, go to [User Credentials for Rhombus Key App](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/22238114934029). |

## Add Multiple Users

To add multiple users, you will need to upload a .csv template. Below is an example table and a list of descriptions of the terms:

```
firstName,lastName,email,role,sendWelcomeEmail,groupNames,rhombusKeyAccessEnabled,remoteUnlockEnabled,sendKeyAppWelcomeEmail,credentials
John,Smith,"john.smith@test.com","Super Admin Group",true,"AC Group1,AC Group2",true,true,true,R:ABC17456
Jane,Williams,"jane.williams@test.com","Super Admin Group",true,"AC Group2",false,false,true,WH10301:12849:102
Maria,Davis,"maria.davis@test.com","Super Admin Group",true,"AC Group2",false,false,false,S:ABC38635
James,Baker,"james.baker@test.com","Installer",true,"AC Group2",false,false,false,W64BITRAW:184467440737095
```

Supported access control credential types:

- `R` (Rhombus Secure Card). Format: `type:cardSerialNumber`
- `S` (Standard Card). Format: `type:cardSerialNumber`
- `WH10301` (Wiegand H10301 Card). Format: `type:cardSerialNumber:facilityCode`
- `W64BITRAW` (Wiegand 64-bit Raw Card). Format: `type:cardSerialNumber` ``

**Note:** The only required fields are first name, last name, and email. Keep in mind that you cannot update users with this pathway, and groups and roles need to be created before uploading.

## Delete a User

| ![Screenshot 2024-12-05 at 3.27.32 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32469747483149) |
| 2\. Ensure the "Partners" tab is selected at the top of your screen. Click "Add Partner" in the upper left corner, and a pop-up will appear. |
| ![Screenshot 2025-04-23 at 1.28.03 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36073330413453) |
| 3\. In the pop-up, select whether the Partner will be a Certified Partner or a Third-Party Partner from the drop-down. |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 12.28.26 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32666572736909) |
| 4\. Finish filling in the fields by searching for the partner you wish to add, providing them with a specific access role, and setting an expiration if desired. Once completed, click "Add Partner."<br>**Note:** There will be different options to fill in based on the type of partner selected. |
| ![Screen Recording 2025-04-28 at 4.53.22 PM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36195712221197) |

**Note:** If the partner does not have a Rhombus account, select "Add Third-Party Partner." When adding a partner this way, clicking on the partner's name will bring up a shareable access link that can be sent to them.

### Add Rhombus Support

In many cases, Rhombus Support may need console access to troubleshoot an issue you are experiencing. Temporary console access can be granted via the "Add a Partner" option in the console.

**Note:** For security purposes, Rhombus Support partner access is set to expire after 72 hours by default.

## Rhombus Cloud Archiving

Rhombus Cloud Archiving allows you to easily back up video footage stored locally on the camera to a secure Rhombus data center.

Cloud Archiving is a separate per-camera license that can be added to any Rhombus camera in increments of 30 days (30, 60, 90, 180 days, or more).

Access to Cloud Archiving data is available for terms of 1, 3, 5, or 10 years. The Rhombus Enterprise Cloud License includes 30 days of Rhombus Cloud Archiving.

## Cloud Archiving Technical Details

Rhombus intelligent security cameras are capable of storing up to 180 days of full-motion, high-definition video directly on the camera, depending on the camera model, storage capacity, and recording settings. Cloud Archiving allows the on-camera video data to be transmitted to an offsite secure data center storage location independent of the camera's storage.

Once a Cloud Archiving license is applied to a Rhombus camera, the camera will start sending video data to the cloud almost in real-time or with scheduled uploads. The upload bandwidth usage depends on the camera's recording quality settings and is usually measured in kilobytes per second, rather than megabytes per second for high-bandwidth cameras.

### Cloud Archiving Retention

Cloud Archiving records and retains each camera stream separately, including index seek points of defined events until the licensed retention period is reached. After this, older video data stored in the cloud is overwritten. For example, with a 30-day license, video data from 'Day 31' will overwrite 'Day 1' in the Cloud Archiving data center. To retain video data for a longer period, additional 30-day Cloud Archiving licenses can be applied per camera.

**Note:** The cloud-archive duration based on licensing is not retroactive. This means that footage uploaded before a licensing change will adhere to the original license's expiration. Once the footage exceeds the previous license's expiration and reaches the date when the new license is applied, the new expiration will take effect.

- Example: If a 30-day license was enabled up until Nov 6th, and on Nov 6th, an additional 30 days is added for a total of a 60-day license:
  - Footage uploaded on Nov 5th will expire on Dec 5th, following the original 30 day expiration.
  - Footage uploaded after the Nov 6th license addition will now have the 60-day expiration, and this will be reflected in the console as the "Days Stored in Cloud" counter and begin moving past the original 30-day license. Nov 7th footage would be considered day 31 once Dec 7th is reached.
  - The console will reflect "30 days stored in the cloud" until Dec 7th, even though the additional archiving was enabled on Nov 6th.

Once Cloud Archiving is enabled for a camera, all stored footage will be saved at the camera's configured resolution at the time of recording. If you want to adjust the resolution, you can easily do so in the camera settings.

### Removing Cloud Archiving

Unregistering a camera will delete cloud-archived footage from the console unless certain precautions are taken. Please contact [Rhombus Support](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/10055806823565-Cloud-Archiving#h_01J0Y9RN48DAM9NX6JA7B0RGB3) for more details or see our article on [Retaining Cloud Footage when Unregistering a Device](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/11042281268365-Retaining-Cloud-Footage-when-Unregistering-a-Camera).

## Enabling Cloud Archiving

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1\. Once purchased, your local authorized Rhombus reseller or the Rhombus Support team will create a license for each Cloud Archiving product purchased.<br>After logging in to the Rhombus Console, go to Settings > Licenses & Features. | ![Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 10.34.15 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32353903693709) |
| 2\. On the Licenses & Features page, make sure the 'Cameras' device type is selected. Then, find the box for Additional Cloud Archiving license near the top of the page and click on 'Manage'. | ![mceclip4.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/10448032976781) |
| 3\. From the Manage pop-up window, choose the Rhombus camera(s) to which you want to assign the Cloud Archiving license(s).<br>Keep in mind that Cloud Archiving is available on a per-camera basis. If you need Cloud Archiving for more than one Rhombus camera, you will need multiple Cloud Archiving licenses. | ![mceclip5.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/10448034883597) |
| 4\. Your Rhombus camera will automatically start securely transmitting video data to the Cloud Archiving data center. You can check how many days of video data are stored in the Cloud Archiving data center from the Settings & Details section of the specific camera page.<br>To do this, go to Devices in the Left Navigation bar, choose the desired camera, and scroll down to the Settings & Details section. | ![mceclip6.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/10448051542413) |

## Disabling Cloud Archiving

If the cloud archiving license is removed, you will lose access to past cloud footage, but it will not be deleted until it naturally expires (based on the length of the cloud archiving license).

If you reapply the license, you will still have access to any past cloud footage that has not yet expired.

## Schedule a Cloud Upload Time

By default, video footage will be uploaded to the cloud at all hours of the day. However, to minimize bandwidth consumption during normal business hours, you can schedule your cameras to upload video footage during a specific time window.

1\. To begin, navigate to Settings -> Cloud Upload Time.

2\. Ensure the toggle labeled "Upload continuously as footage is received for all cameras" is turned off.

3\. Choose to use the same schedule for all cameras and locations or customize the upload times based on locations or camera(s).

4\. Lastly, choose the Start and End times for uploading cloud footage, and click "Save" in the upper right corner.

## Bulk Exporting Cloud Archiving Data

Any footage lasting over an hour can be locally downloaded via our API. This can be provided upon request, but custom development will be needed on the customer's side and will not be managed by Rhombus.

## Cloud Archive Data Storage

Rhombus utilizes multiple redundant cloud data center locations. Each Cloud Archiving datacenter location is secured using industry-leading cybersecurity best practices, data encryption, and, of course, physical security. Various cloud data center locales ensure data sovereignty compliance with local regulations.

## Lockdown Plans

Lockdown Plans configure what happens in an emergency situation. They allow you to set what doors will be locked/unlocked, who will still have access to unlock a door, and who has permission to activate a lockdown in the Rhombus Key App.

To activate a lockdown, you must have specific permissions granted.

- For console activation, you must have permission to manage Access Control peripherals for the location the lockdown plan is associated with. Please review the [Role Creation and Management](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000986871-Role-Creation-and-Management) article for more information on roles and permissions.
- For activation within the Rhombus Key app, you must be included as a Rhombus Key user who can activate a lockdown plan when the plan is created.

## Overview

Using Locations in the Rhombus console is a great way to break out various areas of one organization, allowing for granular management and access to each designated location.

As an administrator, you have several tools to help you manage each one of those locations.

**Note:** The [Using Floor Plans](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044233732-Using-Floorplans) article details how to use Rhombus' floor plan feature.

## Set Up the Genea Integration

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Log into your Genea dashboard and create a Global API Key. The [following documentation](https://help.getgenea.com/en/articles/5366419-global-overview-api-keys) article will walk you through that process. Keep the API key handy—you’ll need it in Step 3. |
| 2\. Log into the Rhombus console and go to Settings > Third Party Integrations > Badge Systems > Genea<br>![Screenshot 2024-02-21 090939.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24786358408333) |
| 3\. Paste your API key into the API token field, then select Submit. <br>![Console_Settings_-_Third_Party_Integrations__2_.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360094659751)<br>The integration is now active! You can now modify settings, associate any camera with a badge reader, and select which events you want to automatically record. |

## Capture Events and Review Footage from Badge Entries

With the Genea integration, Rhombus is automatically configured to capture the following events:

1. When someone enters with a badge
2. When a face does not match the badge used

By combining Rhombus security cameras with Genea’s technology, organizations can improve their access control experience, eliminate abuse from outside parties, and verify who is entering their space at a given time.

In the Rhombus Console, motion, people, and vehicle events are automatically created and indexed in the video feed. This feature saves users hours of investigative work every day and allows them to pinpoint and find specific events without having to manually rewind or fast forward through footage.

![genea.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360094680991)

Rhombus event indexing synchronizes with the Genea’s access control functionalities. All Genea events and activities are automatically indexed so that you can filter or skip to a particular event, allowing you quickly investigate and secure entry points.

With this integration, the system automatically learns people’s faces based on their badge and verifies that the correct person is entering your building.

This ensures that you no longer have to manually review video footage to identify if the correct face is using the correct badge.

## Stop Alarm Monitoring with Badge Entry

Rhombus supports disabling Alarm Monitoring with an authorized badge entry when using the Genea Access Control integration.

**Note:** Genea does send remote unlock events to disarm. Using Remote Unlock and in-person badge events will disable alarm monitoring.

### Console Setup

If monitoring is on manual mode: disarms until user manually re-arms.

If monitoring is on scheduled mode: disarms until user manually re-arms or the schedule indicates monitoring should start.

## Browser Notifications Overview

Browser notifications are messages that can be sent to a user's web browser, even when the website is not actively in use. They are similar to the notifications that you receive on your phone from apps, and they can be used to notify users of new content, updates, or other important information.

## Enabling Browser Notifications

Below are instructions on enabling browser notifications for the browsers Rhombus supports (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Firefox).

### Google Chrome

1\. To begin, click the symbol to the left of the URL. This will display the currently enabled website settings.

## Omnilert Overview

Omnilert Gun Detect is an advanced system that employs AI-powered visual gun detection software combined with emergency notification capabilities. When integrated with Rhombus, it delivers a comprehensive approach that spans the entire spectrum of gun threat detection, alerting, and crisis control. To learn more about the benefits of Rhombus and Omnilert, follow the link [here](https://www.rhombus.com/integrations/omnilert/).

## Setting up Omnilert

To set up the integration, you will need the following:

1. Rhombus Webhook Token (for Notifications & Alerts)
2. Rhombus API Key (for Camera Import)
3. Omnilert Configuration

### Rhombus Webhook Token

Below are steps for integrating with the Rhombus Console and retrieving the Webhook Token needed for Omnilert.

1\. First, follow the flow below to set up the integration.

**_Note: If you do not see the Omnilert logo on the Third Party Integrations page, please reach out to Rhombus Support._**

```
Rhombus Web Console > Settings > Third Party Integrations > IoT Integrations > Omnilert
```

2\. Next, toggle the integration on for Omnilert, choose the camera(s) to associate with for gun detection events, add additional checks (save clips and alerts), and click "Save."

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/23003568426253)

3\. After saving your configuration, you should now see a Webhook Token available. You will then copy the Webhook token and add it to Omnilert. To see where to add this token on the Omnilert side, please see [this section of the article](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/23002918897421-Omnilert-Integration#h_01HKTE471FBGM6XMSTZ90MF5CE).

4\. After adding the Webhook to Omnilert, the final step on the Rhombus side will be to ensure that the correct user alerts for "Gun Detect Event" are checked in the alert notifications.

![Snip20240107_166.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/23003561518989)

## **Zapier Overview**

Zapier is the leader in workplace automation, empowering organizations to automate workflows. When integrated with Rhombus it streamlines daily tasks by connecting Rhombus Rules Engine to any app in minutes. This integration is connecting Rhombus to over 7000 apps, to learn more visit [this](https://www.rhombus.com/integrations/zapier/) page.

## **Setting up the integration**

To set up this integration, you will need the following:

1. Rhombus API
2. Zapier account and configuration

### Rhombus API Key

The first part of the setup involves creating a Rhombus API Key for your individual user account. Below are the steps on how and where to set that up in the Rhombus Console.

1\. Follow the flow below to get to the API page.

```
Rhombus Web Console > Settings > API Management
```

2\. After getting to the page, go ahead and click the "Add API Key" option in the right-hand corner.

3\. Next, you will put a name, have the drop-down be API token, and change the role to Super Admin - If available.

4\. Finally, after hitting the "Submit" button, you will have the ability to show and copy the API Key.

### Zapier Account and Configuration

Next, navigate to [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) and create your account. Once created, you will see a page like this:

![Screenshot 2024-09-10 at 2.43.52 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30147155901837)

Go to "Create Zap" on the upper left corner, and you will see a workflow on the screen like this:

![Screenshot 2024-09-10 at 2.46.25 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30147155902733)

We are going to explore how to add an Excel row every time there is a serial number in pending registration state.

To start configuring the automation flow, click on "Trigger ". If the trigger is physical ( such as a button press) you can skip scheduling the timeframe. For this example, let's add a scheduled frequency. The following window will appear on the right:

![Screenshot 2024-09-10 at 3.56.43 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30147155903757)

Move to the next step "Configure" and set your frequency type, interval, start date, and time of day. Lastly, you can choose to test the trigger, and you're all set with step 1!

![Screenshot 2024-09-10 at 4.00.14 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30147244340109)

Next, let's configure an action. In this example, the trigger was the time-frequency but we could also choose a rhombus trigger like a button press, new camera clip, new sensor event...

Press on the action button and type in Rhombus as your app. After choosing your action event you will have to choose your rhombus account.![Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 10.06.11 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30170391776525)

To link a Rhombus account to Zapier for the first time, go to "Connect a new account".

![Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 10.07.55 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30170391779469)

Zapier will redirect you to a page like this below. Input your name, email and Rhombus API Key.

![Screenshot 2024-09-10 at 12.43.20 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30170391780877)

Test your rhombus action and hit "Continue" at the bottom right.

![Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 10.13.08 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30170404372621)

To add a secondary action just click on the plus icon below your last action, and another action bounding box will appear. This time the app chosen will be Microsoft Excel. Choose an action event and an account. Zapier will redirect you to your Microsoft Excel login page.

![Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 10.18.51 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30170391784589)

Go to the "Configure" step and choose further conditions based on the use case.

![Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 10.21.02 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30170404381325)

Test the automation, hit "Publish" and you're all set!

## Create a Custom App

Before enabling the Box Integration in the Rhombus console, you will need to create a custom app within the Box console.

1\. Log into your Box account and select "Dev Console" in the lower left-hand corner.

![Screenshot 2024-10-28 at 3.04.43 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/31434640699789)

2\. Next, click "Create New App" in the upper right-hand corner, then select "Custom App."

![Screenshot 2024-10-28 at 3.08.25 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/31434621496973)

3\. When the modal opens, enter an app name, select "Integration" under the "Purpose" drop-down menu, select "Security & Compliance" under "Categories," and type "Rhombus" in the "external system" field. Click "Next," then "Create App," to complete the custom app creation.

![Custom App Modal.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/31434621497869)

## Authorize Access

1\. From the Box homepage, click "Dev Console," then select the custom app you created in the previous section.

2\. Select the "Configuration" tab at the top of the screen and scroll down to "Add and Manage Public Keys." Click "Add Public Key" and enter the value "kvpo7mr30eip126uw0e6yt964yw23y5p" in the empty field.

![Screenshot 2024-10-28 at 3.27.05 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/31434621500045)

## Locating the Enterprise ID

You can find your Enterprise ID by going to the Admin Console and clicking Account & Billing. You should see a field labeled "Enterprise ID."

## Folder ID

You can select the folder you want clips to be saved under, but it MUST be a folder that is owned by the Rhombus application.

1\. Log in to Box as the root admin and click "Admin Console" on the left.

2\. Click "Content" on the left.

3\. In the "filter by user" text box, type Rhombus.

4\. If you click on the Rhombus user, you should see "Rhombus Systems - Cloud Video Security's Files."

5\. If you right-click on the user name on the left side, you should see an option to "Login to user's account."

6\. This will take you into the Rhombus application's storage space and allow you to view newly created files or create a directory to save them to.

### Locating the Folder ID

1\. Go to the file navigator in your browser and choose “All Files”.

2\. Click through the hierarchy until you are in the folder you want to use. (Note: The URL in your browser should look something like [https://rhombussystems.app.box.com/folder/59715232153/](https://rhombussystems.app.box.com/folder/59715232153/).)

3\. The last number in the URL (59715232153 in the example above) is the Folder ID.

## Overview

Rhombus has two Relay solutions available, Relay Core and Relay Lite.

Relay Core (N100) is physical hardware that integrates existing third-party cameras for a phased migration to cloud-managed physical security. The N100 lets organizations easily upgrade their existing cameras and gain the benefits of the Rhombus platform.

Relay Lite is ideal for mixed camera environments. Relay Lite is a no-hardware solution that uses Rhombus cameras to integrate third-party cameras for seamless, extended visibility. Rhombus Relay Lite enables organizations to incorporate select third-party cameras into their existing Rhombus deployment for complete visibility.

**Note:** Third-party cameras currently need to have h.264 encoding format to integrate with Rhombus.

## Relay Core (N100)

Relay Core transforms up to 10 (ten) third-party RTSP streaming cameras into a smart camera on the Rhombus console. The N100 provides up to 20 days of storage per camera.

Third-party cameras that are ONVIF Compliant or listening on the standard RTSP port (554) are able to be auto-discovered. Otherwise, the camera can be manually entered using the RTSP URL as detailed in step 6.

### Installation and Console Setup

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Power on the relay and connect it to the same network the third-party cameras are on.<br>**Note:** The first time the relay boots up, it needs to update which can take up to 20 minutes. Once this update is complete, the registration should go through. |
| 2\. Navigate to "Settings" and select "Third-Party Cameras." |
| ### ![Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 3.17.59 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35094072711565) |
| 3\. Select the "Rhombus Relay Cores" tab. Any pre-registered devices will show up in this section. If a device needs to be registered, click "Register Relay Core." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 3.24.12 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35094209673613) |
| 4\. While the relay core is updating, click "Manage Usernames & Passwords." Usernames and passwords are needed for the third-party camera streams to be validated. Storing them allows for the Rhombus to automatically validate any streams and reduces the need to manually validate. |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 11.29.53 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35151108934797) |
| 5\. Input the Username, Password, and any additional Notes you want to use to identify the third-party camera that has been inputted. Click "Add." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 11.32.29 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35151108935821) |
| 6\. Click on the name of the relay core. This will take you to the page where you can assign cameras, remove cameras, reboot, unregister, and edit the name/location. <br>**Assign Validated Cameras**\- These are cameras that the core has already validated and can automatically detect.<br>**Add Camera** \- Manually validate by adding the camera's RTSP URL and then add a camera that is not showing up under validated cameras.<br>If the camera cannot be validated, you may need to log into the camera stream and adjust the encoding format to h.264. |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 3.37.23 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35094655468301) |

### Console Navigation

Once cameras have been assigned to a Relay Core, the camera streams will be available to view under "Cameras" in the Devices tab.

You can differentiate these from Rhombus cameras because "Third-Party" will be displayed in place of a serial number.

![Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 3.47.36 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35094948558477)

- You can set a policy, use AI analytics, and share a stream as you would with other Rhombus cameras.
- An Enterprise license can be applied by navigating to "Settings" and clicking "Manage" under Licenses & Features. For more information on how to apply and toggle on features for an enterprise license, please review the [Console Features & Licensing](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404466850957-Console-Features-Licensing#h_01F9Z1M5N5QQFAH4VJJ2W9Z0R4) article.
- Relay Core streams can be added to video walls. For more information, please review the [Managing Video Walls](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004103891-Managing-Video-Walls) article.
- [Alarm Monitoring](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/7717785765133-Alarm-Monitoring-Guide) is compatible with Relay Core ONLY.

**Note:** You cannot set a static IP address, as the Relay Core is the IP address.

#### Image Settings

Currently, image settings for third-party streams will need to be changed directly through that camera's UI. Once the changes are made, they will be reflected in the Rhombus Console.

### Notifications

Relay core streams can be selected for notifications, similar to other Rhombus cameras.

**Note:** Disconnect/Connect notifications will not work for third-party camera streams, as the Rhombus system does not have access to the health of third-party cameras.

## Relay Lite

Relay Lite provides a simple path for consolidating existing cameras into the Rhombus Console for unified live viewing and management. One third-party camera stream is supported per Rhombus camera.

The third-party camera can be manually entered using the RTSP URL.

### Console Setup

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Power on the third-party camera and connect it to the same network the Rhombus cameras are on. |
| 2\. Navigate to "Settings" and select "Third-Party Cameras." |
| ### ![Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 3.17.59 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35094072711565) |
| 3\. Click on the "Third-Party Cameras" tab. |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 9.30.01 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35114373117453) |
| 4\. Here you can Manage Usernames & Passwords for the third-party camera streams, add a new third-party camera, and validate and assign any streams to a Rhombus Core. <br>Adding Usernames and Passwords under "Manage Usernames & Passwords" will allow the associated RTSP streams to be automatically connected by Rhombus. |
| 5\. If a camera stream has not auto-populated, click "Add Third-Party Camera." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 1.29.48 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35155852578573) |
| 6\. Assign the camera to a location and enter the RTSP URL. <br>If the username and password has been saved under "Manage Usernames & Passwords", toggle on the Authentication to auto-connect. Otherwise, toggle this selection off to manually enter the Username and Password for the third-party camera. <br>Click "Validate." Once the validation has completed, you will be able to give the camera a name and assign it to Relay Lite. Click "Assign" to finish the process. |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 1.31.42 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35155852580109) |
| 5\. To assign an auto-validated camera to Relay Lite, click "Assign." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 9.36.15 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35114616573069) |
| 6\. Provide the camera with a name and select "Relay Lite" from the "Assign To" dropdown menu. Click "Assign" when finished. |
| ## ![Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 9.33.44 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35114616574477) |

### Console Navigation

The assigned camera will now be available for viewing under cameras in the "Devices" tab.

For Rhombus Lite, only the livestream is available. To use features with the stream, the third-party camera needs to be assigned to a Rhombus Core.

You can edit the name/location as well as unassign the camera.

![Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 9.40.10 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35114915674253)

Relay Lite streams can be added to video walls. For more information, please review the [Managing Video Walls](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004103891-Managing-Video-Walls) article.

#### Image Settings

Currently, image settings for third-party streams will need to be changed directly through that cameras UI. Once the changes are made, they will be reflected in the Rhombus console.

## Bandwidth Requirements

The bandwidth used when live streaming a camera depends on the amount of motion and type of camera.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Camera** | **WAN Live Streaming Bandwidth Range** |
| R120 | 530Kbps - 720Kbps |
| R170 | 530Kbps - 720Kbps |
| R200 | 530Kbps - 720Kbps |
| R230 | 530Kbps - 720Kbps |
| R360 | 480Kbps - 1440Kbps |
| R400 | 530Kbps - 1440Kbps |
| R500 | 530Kbps - 1440Kbps |
| R510 | 530Kbps - 1440Kbps |
| R520 | 530Kbps - 720Kbps |
| R600 | 530Kbps - 720Kbps (per image sensor) |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Audio Gateway** | **WAN Live Streaming Bandwidth Range** |
| A100 | 32Kbps - 52Kbps |

**Note:** This bandwidth is only taken when a camera is being actively streamed.  Otherwise, the upload bandwidth consumption is 10 - 30 Kbps during regular operation for the Rhombus cameras. For the Audio gateway, the upload bandwidth consumption is 2 – 10 Kbps during normal operation. If the camera is being streamed locally, no WAN bandwidth is consumed as all streaming occurs over the LAN.

## Bandwidth Reporting

#### Device Page

You can view the bandwidth usage of any camera by navigating to the camera, selecting the "Historical Data" tab, and scrolling down slightly.

![Screenshot 2025-03-13 at 10.39.28 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34990931826957)

#### Home Page

You can view the average camera bandwidth on the Home dashboard under "Reports."

![Screenshot 2025-03-13 at 10.41.58 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34990902556557)

#### Logs and Reports Page

Under the "Logs and Reports" tab, you can select "Bandwidth." Here you can compare different cameras and select a time range to view upload and download.

## Variable Bitrate

Rhombus is committed to ensuring the lowest possible bandwidth consumption on customers' networks while maintaining the highest possible video quality. We have implemented the use of smart VBR (variable bit rate), which enables the cameras to greatly reduce bandwidth consumption when there is little change or motion in the camera field of view.

## Minimize Bandwidth Consumption

Although Rhombus cameras are designed to consume as little bandwidth as possible, you may find that your cameras consume more bandwidth than anticipated. This section will cover a few ways to minimize bandwidth consumption.

### Reduce AI Detections

The most effective way to minimize bandwidth consumption from your Rhombus devices is by reducing the types and amounts of AI detections enabled on your cameras. Each AI detection feature can consume a different amount of bandwidth. The chart below indicates the general level of bandwidth consumption generated by each detection.

![Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 2.59.19 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35150516193677)

#### Utilize Activity Regions

By default, AI detection features will search a camera's full FoV to identify movement events. Activity regions allow you to highlight the relevant areas of a camera's FoV to limit the AI detections to the highlighted area. If human movement detection is enabled on a camera that has a busy street in the background, an Activity Region can reduce bandwidth consumption as the camera will only search in the relevant areas within a camera's FoV.

See our article on [Configuring Activity Regions](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002020671-Configuring-Activity-Regions) for more details.

### Optimize Bit Rate and Resolution

A camera's bit rate and resolution settings can significantly impact the amount of bandwidth they consume. Reducing bit rate and image resolution can help minimize bandwidth consumption.

|     |
| --- |
| Max bit rate and resolution settings can be adjusted within a camera's settings in the camera viewer. |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 10.31.52 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35150516195085) |

### Reduce the Number of Active Streams

Reducing the number of active streams is another great way to minimize bandwidth consumption. If multiple users view different points of footage from the same camera at the same time, that camera will produce multiple streams and, therefore, use additional bandwidth. Adjusting user permissions to ensure only the necessary users have access to historical footage will help with minimizing bandwidth consumption. See our article on [Role Creation and Management](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000986871-Role-Creation-and-Management#h_01HCJGMANBXBS1PMTM3V2P6BBG) for more information.

Video walls can be another source of unexpected bandwidth consumption. Video walls will pull multiple cameras' live streams into one viewer. This means that when viewing a video wall, multiple video streams will be actively using bandwidth.

### Manage Cloud Upload Time

Managing when your cameras upload footage to the cloud won't change overall bandwidth consumption but can reduce the pressure on your network during high-usage times.

**Note:** Editing the cloud upload time will delay when footage is transferred to the cloud. Therefore, all historical footage may not be in the cloud should a camera lose power/network connection.

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Navigate to "Settings" and select "Cloud Upload Time." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-13 at 12.49.31 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35150516196621) |
| 2\. Choose to use the same upload time for all locations/cameras or customize upload times per location or camera. |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-13 at 2.24.28 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35150499637901) |

### Schedule Firmware Updates

Scheduling firmware updates outside of your normal high-usage times won't reduce overall bandwidth consumption but will reduce the pressure on your network during those times.

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Navigate to "Settings" and select "Firmware Updates." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 1.42.15 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35150516200589) |
| 2\. On this screen, you can choose when you'd like your firmware updates to take place and the duration of the updates.<br>**Note:** To ensure your devices have enough time to complete an update, you must have a minimum of 8 hours of allotted time. |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 1.53.57 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35150499640973) |

## Video Delay when Streaming

Many IP camera solutions struggle with live HD video streaming.  The Rhombus solution offers near real-time with an average latency of the below stats depending on where you are streaming:

< 200 milliseconds on LAN (local network streaming)

< 500 milliseconds on WAN (remote streaming)

The actual performance can vary depending on the number of cameras being streamed concurrently, the distance from those cameras, and the available bandwidth on the network.

## Video Streaming

Each camera comes with an embedded microSD card which serves as the primary storage mechanism for all video data. When a user wants to view either live or past footage, it is streamed directly from the camera to the user’s viewing device. The exact mechanics vary depending on whether the viewer and the camera are on the same LAN, but there is no configuration required to make both work seamlessly. The video player automatically detects the network.

- **LAN:** When on any network where the private IP address of a camera is routable from a user’s laptop or mobile device (so not strictly on the same LAN), the video player will automatically stream video directly from the camera instead of going out through the internet. This means that no internet bandwidth will be consumed, and the video feed will experience extremely low latency. The connection to the camera will take place over port 8000.
- **WAN:** On an outside network instead of going directly to the camera, which would require ingress ports to be opened up in a firewall, video streaming is proxied through our geo-distributed Video Streaming servers. Each camera initiates and maintains a persistent connection to a server on port 443, while the video player makes its own connection to the same server. Video content is then piped between the player and camera, with the server acting as a tunnel. Bandwidth used over the WAN typically averages between 120 and 1400 Kbps depending on the camera type and resolution.

Regardless of LAN or WAN, streaming is performed over a low-level web socket connection. A custom, lightweight, binary protocol is used to control the data flow and keep data transmission as efficient as possible. While streaming live footage, our cameras automatically detect transmission speeds and will adapt the video quality based on the consumption speed of the video player.

## Local Recording

On each camera, H.264 encoded video is stored in 2-second segments on the local /ext4 filesystem. The size of each segment varies substantially based on the amount of content captured. Light, movement, and area under purview are the biggest variables. These variables can cause segments to fluctuate from as small as 20 KB to as large as 500 KB.

The storage mechanism works like a circular buffer, expunging old data only when new data needs to be written. This creates a fairly constant sliding window of time available to view, typically around 15 to 45 days, depending on the storage model. Once data has expired, it is no longer available for viewing.

## Cloud Recording & Policy Events

When Cloud Archiving is enabled on a camera, segments of locally stored footage are continuously sent directly to our cloud storage service (Amazon S3). Once enabled, all past footage will be streamed from the cloud unless you are connected via LAN. Viewing live footage will always be streamed directly from the camera and will prioritize a LAN connection.

Policy events are configured to intelligently upload content to the cloud where more substantial analysis can take place. Selective video clips are uploaded in 30-second blocks, finding a balance between consuming upload bandwidth and identifying activity. The camera does a first pass of analysis, further restricting uploads to only content worth analyzing. The bandwidth usage for policy events varies significantly by the amount of activity the camera detects.

## Offline Mode

If a connected camera loses its internet connection (either over WiFi or ethernet), it will continue to record as long as the power is uninterrupted. Since the cameras are writing segments locally, that continues with or without network access. However, no new movement events (motion, human, vehicle, etc.) will be shown on the seek bar during this time. Once the camera comes back online, all missing events will be populated, and the video will be remotely accessible again.

If Cloud Archiving is enabled, you can view past footage online while the camera is offline. Furthermore, once the camera comes back online, the missing footage will automatically be uploaded to the cloud.

When the camera reconnects, it will auto-scan for certain ports including the NTP/123 port. This port must be open for the camera to connect to an NTP server and obtain time to re-assimilate the footage in the proper timeline. If this port is blocked or the connection is inaccessible, then the camera will not begin to record again.

### Unregister a Camera or Audio Gateway from the Mobile App

1\. To unregister a camera or audio gateway from the mobile app, first open the device you wish to unregister.

2\. Next, tap the ![IMG_4554.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34103029486221) button, open "Settings," scroll to the bottom of the page, and tap "Unregister Camera." In the pop-up window, type "DELETE" and tap "Unregister Device."

![RPReplay_Final1738877165.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34103029488653)

### Camera Reset (Final Step)

Once the camera is unregistered, it will typically take 1-3 minutes for it to fully reset itself to factory settings, including deleting all of the previously stored video footage. You’ll know the camera has finished resetting itself when the LEDs flash blue. You can find more on LED statuses [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/14793298069773).

**IMPORTANT** \- If your camera has not fully reset itself before you unplug it, you may have difficulty re-registering it the next time you plug it in. If this is the case, you should plug the camera into ethernet first and wait until the LEDs indicate that it is ready to re-register.

## Unregistering a Sensor

Unlike unregistering a camera, sensors can **only** be unregistered via the mobile app. To unregister a sensor, you must be logged into the organization of the sensor(s) you want to unregister.

**Note:** To unregister a sensor, a BLE-compatible device must be connected to the network and within range of the sensor. Sensors must be unregistered before the Rhombus gateway device is unregistered.

1\. Open the Rhombus Mobile App and navigate to the "Menu" at the bottom-right corner of the page.

2\. Tap "Utilities."

![Mobile App Menu.jpeg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34103746611725)

3\. Tap "Unregister Sensors."

![Unregister Sensors.jpeg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34103762714253)

4\. Select the sensor(s) you want to unregister and complete the process.

## Unregistering Access Control Devices

The process for unregistering an Access Control device (DC20, DR40, or DR20) differs from that of our other Rhombus devices.

### Unregister a Door Reader (DR20 or DR40)

**Note:** At this time, unregistering a DR20 is not supported. Please [Contact Support](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009619768-Unregister-Devices#h_01H93KKEGKXVE0SQ3ZY30894RQ) for assistance.

1\. To unregister a door reader, you'll need to start in the Rhombus Console.

2\. Navigate to "Settings" and select "Door Controllers." Turn off the toggle to "Auto-register Readers" in the area labeled "RS-485 Ports." (See screenshot below).

![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 2.01.18 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34103952769805)

**Note:** If the "Auto-register Readers" setting is enabled and the door reader is still connected to the door controller, your door reader will automatically re-register immediately upon being unregistered.

3\. Once the auto-register setting has been disabled, open the Rhombus Mobile App on your phone.

4\. Navigate to the door reader you plan to unregister. This can be done from the main menu either by tapping "Video Intercoms" and selecting the appropriate reader or by tapping "Doors," selecting the door with the associated reader, and opening the reader camera view.

5\. When viewing the door reader in the mobile app, tap the ![IMG_4554.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34103029486221) button, tap "Settings," scroll to the bottom of the page, and tap "Unregister Camera." In the pop-up window, type "DELETE" and tap "Unregister Device."

![Unregister Video Intercom.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34104233126669)

### Unregister a DC20

1\. To unregister a DC20, all associated door readers and virtual doors must be deleted first. To delete these door readers and virtual doors, navigate to "Settings" and select "Door Controllers" in the Rhombus Console.

2\. On the Door Controllers page, click "Delete" under each virtual door at the top of the page and then click "Confirm" in the pop-up window.

3\. Once all virtual doors have been deleted, scroll to the bottom of the Door Controllers page and click "Delete This Controller."

**Note:** Rhombus suggests reaching out to your Rhombus Account Executive to set up a use case call outlining what the Lumeo solution should do.

## What is Lumeo?

Lumeo is an award-winning "no-code" video analytics platform. It enables you to design and deploy any video analytics use case using “legos” for computer vision, video analytics, and AI.

Using multi-modal dashboards, drag-and-drop tools, pre-built analytics, and ready-to-use AI models, Lumeo makes it easy to analyze and act on video from cameras for a wide variety of use cases tailored to your requirements for Physical Security, Operations, Compliance, Marketing, and other needs.

Lumeo's cloud-managed analytics can run in real time or on archived data. It supports cloud, on-premises, or hybrid models, allowing you to optimize for convenience or cost.

The Lumeo Rhombus integration enables Lumeo to pull Secure Raw streams from Rhombus cameras, analyze them with any analytics in Lumeo, and push data back to Rhombus or to Lumeo's built-in dashboards for visualization.

## How to set up

Below are the steps for setting up the Lumeo integration on the Rhombus side by taking a secured raw stream link of a camera and putting it into Lumeo.

### Rhombus Side

1\. To set up Lumeo integration please follow the path below.

```
Rhombus Web Console > Settings > Third Party Integrations > Lumeo
```

2\. Next, go ahead and toggle the 'Enable LUMEO Integration' to turn the integration on.

3\. Then go ahead and select a camera in the drop-down that you would like to leverage LUMEO for.

4\. Next, navigate to your desired camera and select 'Secure Raw Streams' at the bottom of the 'Camera Details & Settings' page.  ![Snip20221026_42.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/23779382498317)

5\. After clicking on the 'Secure Raw Streams' option you will be shown the option to create a stream.

![Snip20221026_43.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/23779377744525)

6\. Once you have clicked the 'Create' button you will be prompted to provide a name to the stream.

![Snip20221026_44.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/23779382540173)

7\. After entering a name and clicking the create button the final window will open where you can get the link for the stream.

![Snip20221026_45.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/23779382546189)

8\. Lastly, you will want to select 'Copy Link' and navigate to Lumeo.

### Lumeo Side

After logging into the Lumeo console [here](https://console.lumeo.com/) follow the path below to add the Secure Raw stream from Rhombus as an input stream into Lumeo.

```
Lumeo Console > Deploy > Streams > Add Input Stream
```

After going to that page go ahead and select 'Global' or a 'Gateway' for the stream and copy the Rhombus Secure Raw stream link into the 'URI' box and give it a name then go ahead and click 'Save all Streams'. Below is a quick video of this process.

## LAN (Local Area Network)

A LAN, or Local Area Network, is a network that connects computers and devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, school, or office building.

It's typically under the gateway (such as your router or firewall), and all the devices within this area can communicate with each other directly.

### LAN Benefits

One key benefit of having network devices on the same Local Area Network (LAN) is that they can exchange data directly without relying on the Internet. This helps conserve bandwidth and stay within any data usage limits imposed by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

When you view Rhombus cameras over the LAN, your Internet bandwidth remains untouched, resulting in very low latency for the video feed. Additionally, if the Internet goes down, you can still access the cameras through the LAN using either the Mobile App or Apple TV.

To view more about bandwidth with Rhombus devices please go [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038029191).

## WAN (Wide Area Network)

A WAN, or Wide Area Network, is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographical area, such as cities, countries, or even globally. WANs connect multiple local area networks (LANs) and can use various communication technologies, including leased lines, satellite links, and public networks like the Internet.

## Rhombus Console

When viewing a camera on the Rhombus console, you can see how your device is connected to that camera, whether it is LAN or WAN, in the upper right-hand corner.

## What does the ServiceNow Integration do?

ServiceNow is used to automate IT and business processes. This integration acts as an ingestion tool for ALL devices or approval processes. Connecting your cameras can initiate scenarios when cameras are offline, need additional installation, bandwidth issues etc.

## Setup in ServiceNow Console

1\. Get the Instance URL while logged into the ServiceNow console.

- This can be found in the address bar of the browser when using ServiceNow and is typically in the following format: [https://XXXXXXX.service-now.com/](https://xxxxxxx.service-now.com/)![image1-17.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/22391614285197)

2\. Create a Service User (A service user is required for generating API credentials.)

|     |
| --- |
| - Click Users on the left. |
| ![image2-19.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360016580812) |
| - Click New to create a new user. |

**Note:** This feature can only be utilized while viewing cameras on your Local Area Network (LAN)

## Secure Raw Streams vs RTSP

Rhombus's decision to use an alternative to Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is based on security for both our clients and their information. This method will allow you to stream live video over LAN from Rhombus cameras to a third-party application or device. The method we choose provides an H.264 stream over HTTPS, one of the most reliable and widely used video streaming protocols for online videos.

### Secure Raw Stream Details

The Rhombus Secure Raw Streaming feature is a live, stripped-down H.264 stream of the camera feed. Using this stream in an NVR/DVR setup will start downloading the footage to that storage device and, depending on the VMS capabilities, will allow you to view previously downloaded footage as well as real-time footage.

Rhombus recommends having a VLAN set up with DCHP IP reservation just in case the IP address changes after a camera disconnection or reboot. Also, Static IP can be used in place of DCHP.

**Note:** The stream of the camera will not have any AI analytics, timestamp, or event markers.

### RTSP Security Gaps

Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) does not meet the requirement of Rhombus standards for the reasons below:

- RTSP is not encrypted via the channel or route the stream is coming from.
  - This can cause an individual to packet sniff the network and acquire stream data.
- RTSP violates Rhombus's user privacy and security.
  - Having RTSP as a default on our Rhombus cameras would not pass our routine third-party security audits.
- RTSP lacks end-to-end encryption.
- Passwords are exposed as plain text in RTSP URLs.

## Accessing the Secure Raw Stream

1\. To create the Secure Raw Stream, follow the pathway below:

_Log in to the Rhombus Console > Devices > Click on a camera of your choice > Scroll down to "More details" in the "Camera Details & Settings" section & click the drop-down > Select the "Secure Raw Streams" button_

![Snip20221026_42.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/10168911611149)

2\. After clicking on the "Secure Raw Streams" button, you will be shown the option to create the stream.

![Screenshot 2024-06-20 at 3.19.47 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/27747933802765)

3\. After clicking the "Create" button, you will be prompted to provide a name for the stream.

![Snip20221026_44.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/10169901708301) 4\. After entering a name and clicking the "Create" button once more, the final window will open. In this window, you can get the link for the stream by clicking the "Copy Link" button, which is the same resolution the camera is currently running. You can also get a low-resolution link by clicking the "Copy Low Res Link" button, which will be 640p resolution.

## Implementing the Secure Raw Stream

Secure Raw Streaming is ideal for customers who want to integrate Rhombus cameras with their existing NVR/DVR system as they gradually deploy Rhombus throughout their organization, enabling a smoother transition process.

### VMS/NVR

Our Secure Raw Streams can be used in video management software and on an NVR/DVR system. This lets customers stream live footage within third-party apps to facilitate powerful and niche analytics.

### Video Player

Below is an example of how to use the video player [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/) to play the Secure Raw Stream.

## Overview

![Screenshot 2024-03-07 at 9.38.58 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24788145866637)

The Rhombus console can be accessed via the web console and the mobile app (for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rhombus/id1237841963) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1)). This article covers how to use the mobile app as well as its available features.

## Tabs

### Devices

Upon logging into the mobile app, you will land on the "Devices" tab. This page functions as a hub to access all the available registered devices on your account. Every device page provides visibility to the registered devices as well as a general health status for each device.

**Note:** Your view may vary depending on your account permissions and registered devices.

![Devices Tab.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36391341561357)

#### Cameras

Tapping "Cameras" within the "Devices" tab brings up all registered cameras. Tapping a camera thumbnail brings up the associated video feed. Below the video feed are seek points for movement events (human and/or vehicle), as well as buttons to create clips, search for specific dates and times, and advanced search tools. To exit the feed, tap the back arrow in the upper left corner.

![Cameras.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36392713139853)

#### Video Intercoms

The "Video Intercoms" page displays your registered video intercoms (DR40s). Tapping a thumbnail brings up the associated video feed.

When viewing a video intercom feed, you can unmute your microphone to communicate with someone on the other end and/or unlock the associated access control door(s). Activating your mic will not stop you from having 2-way communication. For this to work optimally, the device should have AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancellation) enabled, which is the default for DR40.

By default, doorbell notifications will redirect to the DR40 page.

![Video Intercoms.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36392713143565)

#### Doors

The "Doors" page displays all access control doors on your account. You can unlock a specific door by tapping the lock button on the main page. Selecting a door will display the video feed from the associated camera(s).

![Doors.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36394841741069)

#### Audio Gateways

The "Audio Gateways" page displays your registered A100 devices. Tapping an audio gateway provides the ability to push-to-talk through it, displays the assigned camera(s) and the option to edit them, and provides access to audio controls.

![Audio Gateways.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36395427088525)

#### Door Sensors

The "Door Sensors" page displays your registered D20 sensors, the closed/open status of the doors, and a quick health overview for each sensor, including signal strength and battery life. Tapping a sensor will display the associated camera(s) and a more in-depth overview of its health status.

![Door Sensors.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36396673822477)

#### Environmental Sensors

The "Environmental Sensors" page displays all environmental sensors registered to your account. The main page provides a general health overview, as well as humidity and temperature levels where the corresponding sensor is located. Tapping a sensor will display the video feed from an associated camera and provide a more in-depth breakdown of each reading.

![Environmental Sensors.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36397266661645)

#### Motion Sensors

The "Motion Sensors" page provides a brief overview of all motion sensors registered to your account. Tapping a sensor will provide a more in-depth overview of sensor information, including serial number, firmware version, and time zone.

![Motion Sensors.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36400639395853)

#### Buttons

The "Buttons" page offers a brief health overview, including signal strength and battery life, of all B10 buttons registered to your account. Tapping on a button will provide a more in-depth overview of the button's health, display an assigned camera(s) feed, and give options to enable test mode or configure rules for the selected button.

![Buttons.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36400639398285)

### Locations

The "Locations" page will display all locations where you have registered devices, and a brief health report of the devices. Selecting a location will display thumbnails for all the cameras at the location, and, if you have lockdown plans enabled, the option to activate a lockdown. Tapping a camera thumbnail will open its video feed, as mentioned in the " [Cameras](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037131732-Rhombus-App-Walkthrough#h_01F894YQMPFMANT19FCV7KZ5BE)" section above.

When viewing a location, you can also choose any other device type from the menu at the top of your screen or choose to see additional user and location information.

![Locations.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36402734741773)

### Video Walls

The "Video Walls" tab displays all video walls in your account. Tapping a video wall provides visibility to the camera feeds assigned to that wall. When viewing a video wall, tapping the "Settings" icon in the upper right corner allows you to edit the grid layout and some video wall preferences. Creating and editing video walls must be done in the Rhombus web console.

**Note:** Visibility to video walls or cameras within video walls may vary depending on your user account permissions.

![Video Walls.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36462285881869)

### Alerts

The "Alerts" tab displays all device alerts based on previously created alert policies. Selecting an alert brings up the video clip associated with the alert. These alerts can be shared as needed with an optional expiration date and/or password.

![Alerts.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36462684228749)

### Menu

The "Menu" tab provides access to several different options in your Rhombus console:

- Alarm Monitoring: A hub to view the alarm monitoring status for your console locations and threat cases that have been submitted to the alarm monitoring service.
- Saved Video: View video clips that have been captured and shared.
- Faces: View and manage recent sightings of faces that have passed by cameras in your organization.
- License Plates: View and manage recent sightings of license plates that have been captured by your cameras.

- Register Devices: A wizard to register devices to your console.

![Menu.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36466646394125)

## Features

### Clip Capture

The clip capture feature allows you to easily save clips and share them. To save a clip, tap the scissors icon below a video feed, drag the highlighted area up or down to capture your desired clip, tap "Save Clip," and name it.  Once saved, you can view the clip in the Saved Video tab within the Menu.

![Clip Capture.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36466992894861)

### Zoom & Timeline

When viewing a camera feed, you can zoom in on the timeline to find an event's exact seek point. To zoom in, tap the event or reverse pinch around the event seek point.

## Camera Positioning and Zooming

Lighting, camera angles, and camera positioning all play critical roles in establishing an optimal facial recognition environment. An inadequate setup in any one of these areas may result in missed or inaccurate facial recognition.

### Best Practices

![Facial Recognition Mounting Requirements_V2.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32669125497613)

- **Mounting Position:** Place the camera as close to face level as possible with an angle under 30° from all directions (up, down, left, right).
- **Camera Distance:** Mount at a distance that provides approximately 100 PPF (pixels per foot) on the face at the desired capture point. For maximum distance guidelines, refer to the article on [Optics and Object Distances for Analytics](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048246251-Optics-and-Object-Distances-for-Analytics). Using shorter distances than the maximum listed can help reduce bandwidth consumption.
- **Lighting:** Ensure the camera faces inward to avoid back-lighting and is placed in a well-lit area. Minimize shadows and glare on the face.
- **Focus:** Adjust the camera’s zoom to focus on the intended facial capture area.
- **Encourage Attention:** Position the camera where people will naturally look toward it, such as near a sign or graphic to draw attention.
- **Uncooperative Scenarios:** For cases where individuals don’t actively engage with the camera, try to optimize face capture angles for better results (i.e., avoid side or downward views). Anything that can be done to get a straight shot of the face will enhance the feature's results.
- **Unique People Counting Feature:** For unique people counting, Rhombus recommends mounting the camera above an exit door to capture faces as people leave.

## Search Faces

### Navigate to Search Faces

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Click on the "Investigations" tab and select "Faces." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 9.17.16 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35714761799821) |
| 2\. Click "Search." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 9.18.43 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35714761812877) |

### Search and Filter

You can search for a name that has a match.

You can filter the results by time frame, location(s), camera(s), or label(s).

Toggle on the "Show only matched faces" to filter out any unmatched faces.

![Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 9.21.07 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35714824346637)

### Matched Face Event

Matched face events will provide the confidence percentage the model was when matching the face and the associated name.

![Screenshot 2024-12-16 at 2.15.01 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32770127442189)

If the match is incorrect or needs to be edited in some way, several actions can be taken:

- View similar sightings - View other sightings for faces matched to this name profile.
- Not a face - Mark the image captured as not a face.
- Remove as match - Remove the face as a match to the current name profile.
- Click the label icon to add or create a new label to associate with the name profile.
- You can also directly edit the name of the match by clicking the edit pencil next to the name.

![Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 9.42.30 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35716223674125)

### Unmatched Face Event

An unmatched face event is an instance where the confidence threshold for matching the face did not meet the minimum set in the " [AI Matching Threshold](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/32668973468685-Managing-Facial-Recognition#h_01JEYG3WPWTN28061X2SADG0QN)" section and thus could not confidently match to a person saved in the system.

![Screenshot 2024-12-16 at 2.15.44 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32770350066573)

To edit the event, click on the three dots next to "Unmatched." Here, you can either mark the event as "Not a face" or associate it with a person by adding their name.

**Note:** Adding a name to an unmatched face event will not affect future detection accuracy for that person. All face matching is determined only by the matchmakers loaded and selected in the "Manage Faces" section.

![Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 10.01.22 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35716342927757)

If the name does not already exist as a saved person, you can do a quick add to create a new profile. This will take you to the " [Add a Person](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/32668973468685-Managing-Facial-Recognition#h_01JEYG138EAN90QSTC7J95HG1X)" flow.

## Manage Faces

### Navigate to Manage Faces

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Click on the "Investigations" tab and select "Faces." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 9.17.16 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35714761799821) |

| ![Screenshot 2025-04-09 at 10.06.00 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35716565756173) |

### Photo Selection Best Practices

For optimal face matching, Rhombus recommends a few best practices when choosing images to use as matchmakers.

- **Start with "Upload":** We recommend starting with high-quality front views for the uploaded photo and seeing how the system performs before adding in additional matchmakers from captured footage. Only one uploaded photo per person is needed.
- **Image Clarity:** Use clear images or captures with minimal to no blurring.
- **Face Angle:** For the "Upload" photo, we recommend using a high-quality front-facing image of the person. For additional "Captures from Footage" images, selecting a variety of small angles will assist the model. It is not recommended to have full side views (90 degrees) or multiples of the same angle.
- **Maintain Updates:** If a person has any significant changes, such as growing a beard or getting a haircut, we recommend re-uploading an image of that person and updating any additional matchmakers.

### Add a Person

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Click "Add Person." |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 2.57.33 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32671524919693) |
| 2\. Name the person you are adding.<br>**Optional:** Select images from a camera(s) to add here as matchmakers. If you have not yet uploaded an image, we recommend waiting to select matchmakers until after doing so. You will be able to upload an image once the person's profile has been created. <br>Click "Save" when finished. |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 3.04.07 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32671524926605) |
| 3\. Once the person has been created, you can click the "Upload" icon next to their name. |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 3.08.21 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32671973339917) |
| 4\. Select the image you wish to upload from your computer, and it will populate in the "Uploaded Face" column. <br>**Note:** This system can only recognize human faces and is run through a preliminary detection to ensure quality and compatibility with the model. If a face is not detected (e.g., you tried to upload your cat), you will get the following error message. |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 3.20.45 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32672020619405) |

| ![Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 3.33.48 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32672328157965) |
| 2\. Image naming is important. If you name an image **Jane Smith.jpg,** the created person will also include the space in the name Jane Smith. If dashes are used, these will be included in the person's name in the console if creating a new person. <br>If you want to "Create Person" with the uploaded photos, ensure this toggle is switched on. If the name of the image already matches the name of an existing person, this image will become associated with that profile. <br>Click "Select Image(s) For Upload" to select all images you wish to upload. <br>Click "Upload" when complete. |

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Click the label icon under a person's name. |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 4.09.46 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32673258326669) |
| 2\. Type in the word you wish to use for a label.<br>If it doesn't already exist, click "Create label \[name\]."<br>If it exists and is actively being used with another person, you can select it from the dropdown list. <br>Removing a label from all people it is associated with will permanently remove that label from the dropdown list. |
| ![Screen Recording 2024-12-12 at 4.18.44 PM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32673558350477) |

### Matchmaker Images

These are the faces that will be used for all facial matching for each person. A person can be associated with a maximum of up to five matchmaker photos at a time, with one being an uploaded image and the others being images captured by a Rhombus camera.

Images that can be selected as matchmakers have already gone through a preliminary check. This check looks for a minimum upload quality and meets a specified confidence level. A low confidence level image will not be available to be selected, even if it is a captured image from an event on the search page.

You can add matchmakers when adding an individual [new person](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/32668973468685-Managing-Facial-Recognition#h_01JEYG138EAN90QSTC7J95HG1X) or after a profile has been created by selecting the "+" symbol in the "Captures From Footage" section.

![Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 4.29.26 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32673773712013)

### AI Matching Threshold

Here, you can adjust the threshold the AI Facial Recognition model uses to determine a match with a saved person. The default is set to 70%, which represents the minimum confidence level required to name a person automatically.

Increasing confidence improves AI Matching accuracy but may filter out detections. This could increase the number of unmatched events when searching.

Decreasing confidence reduces AI Matching accuracy, which may result in false positives, or names being associated with the wrong image of a person.

Adjusting confidence doesn't account for environmental factors that impact AI performance. Learn more in the [AI Confidence Settings](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/28950875256333-AI-Confidence-Settings/) article.

|     |

| 1\. Click the dropdown menu in the "AI Matching Thresholds" section. |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 2.40.55 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32670783265165) |
| 2\. Select the value you wish to change the threshold to. The system has a minimum value of 50%. |
| ![Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 2.42.14 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32670844538637) |

1. Reduce the number of cameras in the layout
2. Enable Performance Mode
3. Disable Realtime Streaming
4. Switch from HD to SD

If the issue persists, please contact support.

Video Walls can be used with the Apple TV app. Please review the article on [Apple TV](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410625643533-Using-the-Apple-TV-app) to navigate through the setup.

![Screenshot 2024-05-03 at 11.20.48 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26437284742157)

### Changing Audio Settings

Clicking on the "Audio Controls" button within the device player view (below) will bring up the audio settings that you can adjust.

![mceclip1.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/18562055708301)![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/14187921555213)

**_Note: If you are using external hardware (i.e., TOA horns, separate microphones, etc.), you will want to set your mic and/or speaker sources to "External" within this modal._**

#### **Acoustic Echo Cancelling (AEC)**

AEC is a filter based on an adaptive algorithm that changes this filter to model the acoustic path. The filter's output is then removed from the acoustic path signal to create a “clean” signal output. Any echoes in the calling environment are released.

_**Note: AEC only works with internal mic and speaker.**_

#### **Noise Suppression**

Noise Suppression removes as much noise as possible while causing minimum distortion to the speech of interest. Works best with a single foreground human speaker.

#### **Audio Equalizer**

After clicking the 'Show Audio Equalizer' button, you will be able to adjust the low shelf, three separate peaking levels, and the high shelf. All of these can be changed from +15db to -15db.

_**Note: We recommend making these adjustments while listening in to get immediate feedback regarding the impact of your selections.**_

- "Low Shelf" frequencies typically refer to the range of frequencies below a certain point that is boosted or cut using a low-shelf EQ filter. Examples of this could be reducing the booming of a room by cutting frequencies below 150 Hz or adding more sound to a person's voice by boosting frequencies below 120 Hz. **_Low Shelf: center freq 150 Hz_**
- The three "Peaking" filters allow all frequencies through and add a boost (or attenuation) to a range of frequencies. The first has 2000 Hz as the center frequency, with the other two at 4000 Hz and 8000 Hz as their respective center frequencies. **_Peaking (1): center freq 2000 Hz, Peaking (2): center freq 4000 Hz, Peaking (3): center freq 8000 Hz_**
- "High Shelf" frequencies typically refer to the range of frequencies above a certain point that is boosted or cut using a high-shelf EQ filter. Examples of reducing the hiss and noise in a recording are by cutting frequencies above 16 kHz. **_High Shelf: center freq 16000 Hz_**

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/14193222692877)

### Changing Assigned Cameras

In the upper right corner of the player view, select the drop-down next to "Assigned Cameras."

![mceclip0.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/6774042793229)

From here, you can select what cameras you want to associate the device with. This will allow the footage for the selected devices to be showcased on the Audio Gateway's device page and will allow for the Audio Gateway sound to be heard on the corresponding cameras' device pages.

### Listening in to the Device

Selecting the audio button (below in pink) will allow you to adjust the device's listening volume. Clicking on the speaker icon will automatically turn the volume off or to full, and dragging the blue dot will allow you to select a middle volume. Make sure your machine's volume is up before trying to listen in!

![Screenshot 2024-05-03 at 11.43.33 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26437284754445)

### Speaking Through the Device

Selecting the microphone button (below in pink) will allow you to speak through the device. Click and hold this button to then talk through it. Ensure the internal speaker volume is up so people around the Audio Gateway can hear what is said.

_**Note: In order to speak through the device you will need to be in "Live Realtime" and not "Live Buffered."**_

![Screenshot 2024-05-03 at 11.48.13 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26437284761229)

### Glass Break (Beta), Smoke Alarm (Beta), Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Beta)

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26728408747405)

With our A100, you can create Glass Break, Smoke Alarm, and Carbon Monoxide Alarm alerts whenever the device hears an associated noise. We recommend that the A100 be facing or sideways and pointed to the glass window or corresponding alarm areas, and we recommend that the distance between 6-20ft be the most accurate.

_**Note: This feature is in beta mode. Please contact Rhombus support at [support@rhombus.com](mailto:help@rhombus.com) if you receive any false positives during your experience.**_

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26728512026765)

To assign the policy to an Audio Gateway, click on the "Assigned Sensors" tab to the right of the "Audio Gateway Alert Settings" seen in the screenshot below. Once there, you can add a device by clicking the "Add Device" button and then selecting the device you want to add the policy to.

## Prerequisites

Before you can register a Rhombus camera, you will need:

- Rhombus Console Account
- Mobile phone with downloaded Rhombus App ( [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rhombus/id1237841963))
- Camera connected to network and power
- Provided Waterproofing Kit (reference [this](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020141532-Preventing-Water-Damage) article for details on installation)

## Waterproofing

Following the waterproofing guidelines is essential to ensure your product is covered under our End User License Agreement and Hardware Warranty. Failure to complete the waterproofing steps as outlined in the product manual may void your warranty and limit our liability for related damages. For more information, please refer to our [EULA](https://legal.rhombus.com/end-user-tos/eula).

Use the included accessories to waterproof the cable connection, installing them as shown below. Ensure that the O-ring is in place (and not twisted) between the pigtail and the housing, and lock the housing and pigtail together with a quarter-turn. Using an Ethernet cable without a boot or strain relief is best for fitting easily within the housing. After mounting the camera, ensure the two dome screws are firmly tightened to prevent water ingress.

![R230_wp(edit).png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30707122071437)

For more information on waterproofing, please visit our [Preventing Water Damage](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020141532-Preventing-Water-Damage) article.

## Connecting the Camera

To complete registration, a camera needs power and should be connected to a local network that has access to the internet. Rhombus recommends using a PoE (Power over Ethernet) switch or PoE injector to accomplish this.

- Ensure the switch has power.
- Configure the network to comply with Rhombus requirements. Please reference our [Network Setup Guide](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/6319246804237-Networking-Best-Practices) for more details on network configuration.
- Connect the camera to the PoE switch for power and ethernet. It should automatically boot up and you can begin the registration process.

## Mounting Guide

Below are the steps for mounting the R230 on a wall or ceiling:

1. Open the dome by unscrewing two housing screws with the included Torx tool.
2. Use two included round-head self-tapping screws to mount the base to the surface.
3. Use two included anchors when mounting to softer materials.
4. Replace the dome and tighten two housing screws with the included Torx tool.

- When removing the dome, do not pull on the pigtail.
- It is critical that the dome housing does not cover the Ambient Light Sensor. This determines transitions between night and day.
- For best nighttime performance, ensure that the four IR LEDs are not blocked. If some of them are blocked, nighttime performance may be degraded.

## Aiming the Lens

The lens can be vertically angled 180 degrees and rotated 90 degrees.

## Registration Methods

Once you have powered up your camera and connected it to the internet, it can be registered. Ensure the camera has the correct LED status that indicates it's ready to be registered.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Camera Model** | **Connected to Rhombus Servers** | **Not Connected to Rhombus Servers** | **Registration Failure** |
| R230 | Blinking Blue | 2 Blue \[Pause\] 2 Blue \[Repeat\] | Slow blinking Red IR LEDs |

A full explanation of all LED statuses can be found [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/14793298069773-Device-LED-Statuses).

If the camera does not auto-register when brought online, you can register a camera from the Rhombus Mobile App or via the Rhombus Web Console.

## Mobile App

App Download: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rhombus-systems/id1237841963)

1\. Log in to the app and click "Menu" from the home screen.

![Screenshot_20241121-164600.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35685995986701)

2\. Select "Register Devices."

![Screenshot_20241121-164606.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35685964038797)

3\. Select the preferred registration method: QR Code or Bluetooth.

**Note:** More than one R120/R200 can be registered at the same time via Bluetooth. We recommend registering at least one Bluetooth-enabled camera before registering a sensor.

![IMG_4876.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35685995993997)

4\. Assign the R230 to a location. Choose "Add Location" if you need to add a new location for the device.

![IMG_4877.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35685995996173)

5\. Select the camera connection type: Ethernet or Wi-Fi.

![IMG_4878.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35685995998093)

6\. The last screen will display a QR code that you can hold up to the camera lens to finish registration. When you hear an audible click and the red IR LED's flash, you'll know the camera has accepted the QR code.

**Note:** This step is not needed if registered via BLE.

### Bluetooth Registration (For Wi-Fi)

1\. When registering via Wi-Fi, the R230 needs to be registered via Bluetooth. Select the "Bluetooth" option from the registration wizard.

2\. Add the location you want to assign the R230 to.

**Note:** If you haven't already, you'll need to add a location first either during this wizard, or you can go to the Locations tab and choose "Add Location." Read more about Managing Locations [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009453807-Managing-Locations).

3\. Toggle the slider for the corresponding camera serial number.

**Note:** You can register more than one R230 at once via Bluetooth. It's recommended that you register at least one Bluetooth-enabled camera before you register a sensor.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35685995999245)

4\. Select the Wi-Fi connection type. Ensure the Wi-Fi credentials are entered correctly.

Ensure your wireless network supports the requirements listed in the [Supported Wi-Fi Network and Authentication Protocols](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013839352-Supported-Wi-Fi-Network-and-Authentication-Protocols) article.

**Note:** These credentials are case-sensitive.

![Screenshot_20250408-094105.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35685964052749)

5\. Select the IP configuration by toggling on DHCP.

6\. Once registration is complete, the camera will have a solid blue LED. This can take a few minutes.

### Web Console

1\. To register a camera from the web console, go to the "Devices" tab and select "Register Cameras."

If this is the first camera you are registering, you'll need to add a location first, either during this wizard or by selecting the Locations tab and choosing "Add Location."

![Screenshot 2024-10-25 at 12.35.33 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/31368868636429)

2\. When the registration window pops up, the first prompt asks you to enter your mobile number to receive a link to download the mobile app. If you would prefer to register via the web console, you can ignore this first step and click "Next" at the bottom right.

3\. Select the location where these cameras will be registered and click "Next."

4\. Select whether these devices will be connected over Wi-Fi or Ethernet and click "Next." (For a Wi-Fi setup, you will need to enter the network name and password—these fields are case-sensitive.)

5\. Select which roles will have access to these devices. You can choose between no access, view-only access, or full management permissions.

6\. Select a policy to assign to these cameras and click "Next." (If you would prefer to have different policies applied to multiple cameras, leave the policy selection blank.)

7\. The final screen will display the QR Registration Code. Show this QR Code to any camera that is powered and connected to the internet, and it will register accordingly.

**Note:** If you do not hear a click, try moving the phone toward and away from the camera, or try a different camera lens.

| ![Screen_Shot_2021-03-16_at_6.15.46_PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360089676531) |

You can then associate any camera with a badge reader and select the events you want to be recorded automatically.

## Capturing Events and Reviewing Footage from Badge Entries

With the ProdataKey integration, Rhombus is automatically configured to capture the following events:

- When someone enters with a badge
- When a face does not match the badge used

By combining Rhombus security cameras with ProdataKey’s technology, organizations can improve their access control experience, eliminate abuse from outside parties, and verify who is entering their space at a given time.

In the Rhombus Console - motion, people, and vehicle events are automatically created and indexed in the timeline. This feature saves customers hours of investigative work every day and allows them to pinpoint and find specific events without having to manually rewind or fast forward through footage.

![Screen_Shot_2021-03-16_at_6.16.19_PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360089676591)

This event indexing is also carried over with the ProdataKey integration. All ProdataKey events and activities are automatically indexed so that you can filter or skip to a particular event, allowing you quickly investigate and secure entry points.

This integration also combines the badge information from ProdataKey and connects it to names and faces. This ensures that you no longer have to manually review video footage and identify if the correct face is using the correct badge.

Now with Rhombus, the system will automatically learn people’s faces based on their badge and verify that the correct person is entering your building.

## Stop Alarm Monitoring with Badge Entry

Rhombus supports disabling Alarm Monitoring with an authorized badge entry when using the PDK Access Control integration.

**Note:** PDK does not send remote unlock events to disarm. Disarming alarm monitoring will only work for in-person badge events.

### Console Setup

If monitoring is on manual mode: disarms until user manually re-arms.

If monitoring is on scheduled mode: disarms until user manually re-arms or the schedule indicates monitoring should start.

## What is Single Sign-On?

Single Sign-On, or SSO, is a way to sync sign-on across multiple applications allowing you to log-in to all applications with one user account and password.

## With current users, will anything in their account change when enabling SSO?

Nothing will changed for current users besides redirected to the SSO login page when logging in. If they currently have a valid session, they will not be redirected to the SSO login page.

## How will enabling SSO affect current users? Is mixed authentication supported?

Mixed authentication is not supported. Once SSO is enabled, all current users will be redirected to your SSO provider.

## Will existing users need to select the SSO option and if so will they need the “team name”?

No - existing users do not need to click on SSO Login. New users, that are not in Rhombus, also do not need to click on SSO login as long as the team name matches the new users email domain. If there is a user in your SSO that is not part of your domain, then only the SSO Login option needs to be selected for manual discovery.

## Can existing relationships be used if they are an active user in the SSO provider and in the Rhombus Group and can  their privilege's be managed within the console?

You can manage roles from Rhombus console but note that if there is a matching group that is passed to Rhombus during user authentication, the user's role in console will be updated automatically.

## How do we deal with users that are not on the customers domain but need to have access to Rhombus?

Customers can add third party partners and send temporary account login urls with expiration (Settings -> User Management -> Partners -> Add Third-Party Partner).

## For users added as Partners in my domain, can they use SSO somehow?

Yes - you will need to add the email addresses of the users added in Partners in the SSO provider. For example, if the customer adds [xyz@pd.gov](mailto:xyz@lapd.gov "mailto:xyz@lapd.gov") in the @abccompany.com in the SSO provider, then [xyz@pd.gov](mailto:xyz@lapd.gov) will use the SSO Login button to put in the email [xyz@pd.gov](mailto:xyz@lapd.gov), team name "abccompany" and get authenticated with customers SSO.

## What if the customer doesn’t want to use Azure AD groups? Will that impact the integration?

Users are not required to use Azure AD groups. As longs as the user has not assigned a created, matching, Role with names to "Users" assigned groups in Azure AD. They can manually assign Roles to users in Rhombus console.

## What is the meaning behind "Error: saml message invalid"?

The error message is an indication of incorrect SAML configuration on the customer IDP side. If the customer can login with SAML, that error will not occur. The error message is due to the customer end user not having SAML setup to completion.

## Rhombus Firmware

The Rhombus ecosystem provides regular firmware updates for its devices, which include security patches, feature enhancements, and more. These updates are released approximately once a month, or as needed.

## Setting a Firmware Update Schedule

To minimize network interference, firmware updates can be scheduled for specific times and days of the week.

1\. Navigate to "Settings" and select "Firmware Updates."

![Screenshot 2025-04-16 at 11.12.48 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35907815353229)

2\. Select the days you'd like your devices to update. Updates will only occur if there is one available.  Your devices will update one at a time, beginning at the selected start time. If the updates are unable to finish within the chosen time duration, they will stop until the next scheduled opening. Click "Save."

Click the "Access Control Firmware" tab to set the schedule for Access Control-specific devices. Click "Save."

## Drip Loops

If a cable enters the camera from above, regardless of model, adding a “drip loop” can prevent water from flowing directly into the cable connection. The photos below show the difference between a device with no drip loop in the cable (on the left) and one with a drip loop in the cable (on the right).

![Water_2.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360016182612)

## R1

Ensure that both the gray gasket and the white screw cap are in place and tightly assembled. Check that the gasket forms a tight seal with the ethernet cable. An unusually thin cable may not seal well. In this case, wrap some electrical tape around the cable where the gasket grips it or apply some silicone caulking around the cable exit.

![Water_1.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360016182592)

## R100/R120/R2/R200/R230

Use the included accessories to waterproof the cable connection, installing them as shown below. Ensure that the O-ring is in place (and not twisted) between the pigtail and the housing, and lock the housing and pigtail together with a quarter-turn. It's best to use an Ethernet cable without a boot or strain relief to fit easily within the housing. After mounting, ensure the dome screws are firmly tightened to prevent water ingress.

![R2-Water.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360037646431)

It is crucial to tighten the housing tightly (but not too tight) so the internal O ring can work properly. The below picture demonstrates that when mounted on its side, the O ring and the silica packets inside are the only things stopping the water from getting in.

![mceclip11.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4420195805197)

## R360

The R360 has rubber O-rings on the inside and two on the outside. The photos below showcase where they are located on the camera. It's crucial to place the silica packet inside to prevent water damage.

![mceclip9.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4420183526797)

![mceclip7.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4420183365901)

For older R360 models, the PoE line must be unterminated to attach the protective water gasket.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/15491461554701)

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/15491468468493)

**Note:** Newer models of the R360 will use the same waterproofing kit as the other dome cameras. See the [above section](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020141532-Preventing-Water-Damage#h_01FS5N67JDBZRR5KV9A7KJTTC3) for more details.

## R400

The R400 comes with an attachable gasket that can be screwed into the back or the side of the camera. Two rubber rings protect the side that screws into the camera.

![mceclip4.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4420183067661)

Water-absorbing material also helps prevent the cable from jostling around and potentially giving way to water droplets. Moisture can build up around the cable entry point and potentially get inside the camera, causing damage. Ensure silica packets remain inside the camera's dome, as they will assist in preventing water damage.

![mceclip5.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4420191170701)

The image below demonstrates a sideways-mounted gasket on the R400.

![mceclip2.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4420191144077)

The image below shows a back-mounted gasket on the R400. A conduit plug has been placed on the camera's side to prevent water from entering the unused hole.

![mceclip3.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4420195167757)

## R500/R510

The R500/R510 are naturally waterproof. The hood over the lens provides a natural drip system. There's a rubber O-ring within the lens housing connection as well to prevent water from getting in.

![mceclip0.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4420191097741)

The below picture demonstrates where the pigtail comes out near the mounting holes.

![mceclip1.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4420195137165)

## R600

The R600 comes with a pre-installed waterproofing kit. With the dome removed, unscrew the cable gland using a 26mm hex socket to remove it from the base.

![IMG_20240814_130139343 (1).jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35311365447565)

Remove the waterproof connector. Pull out the grey insert and discard the black plug.

![IMG_20240814_130350685.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30936046987021)![IMG_20240814_130341227.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30936079946893)

Place the ethernet cable into the grey insert.

## Preventing Condensation

Condensation can be a problem with dome cameras, particularly outdoors. When installing outdoors or in other environments with high humidity or variable temperatures, please ensure these steps are completed to mitigate condensation:

### Location

Avoid direct exposure to sunlight and rain. Mounting under an eave or other [protective covering](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1346725-REG/hikvision_srs_sun_rain_shield_wall.html "https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1346725-REG/hikvision_srs_sun_rain_shield_wall.html") is ideal. ![protective_covering.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/21824540288653)

### Screws

Use the screws that come with the camera to mount it on the wall. We recommend creating a pilot hole first and hand-screwing the camera base into the wall. If you would prefer to use different lengths of screws, keep to the gauge of #4 and the same style of Phillips rounded head.

**Note:** We caution against using power tools because they can overtighten and possibly damage the base.

### Mounting

We recommend reviewing our [mounting guide](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051360951-Mounting-a-New-Rhombus-Camera) for instructions on mounting a Rhombus dome camera.

### Desiccant

Place the included moisture-trapping desiccant bag inside the camera before reattaching the dome.![desiccant_placement.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/21824577879821)

### Seal

When the dome is reattached after mounting and aiming, the sealing gasket can sometimes be twisted or unseated. The seal can also be incomplete if the dome screws aren't sufficiently tightened. Check the seal to ensure a properly seated and tight fit.

![incorrect_seal.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/21824577889293)

### Treatments

Anti-fog [wipes](https://www.mcmaster.com/10895t21 "https://www.mcmaster.com/10895t21") and [sprays](https://www.amazon.com/Treatment-Anti-Reflective-Superior-Defogger-Prevents/dp/B07R91W8JJ/ref=sr_1_2?crid=A82T5TCDFVIO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.YJKyicETL7-aZ8huImiPVzPDmnzvZquR31KTjDjgzZbYuEqHIHivP8L6QdF7expH2kfCLAymFBebHqc6JC0tQgNwP3pTv7YFcprl6z0SZs9xJvp3BVaoxUF2onjfrxLDHYyPXgp5vBAfa9O_WvzIrhi37MmcfAeKXQIxnHH54ZYDqiTQx_b7-AArhauUoZVEXeRq9MUdu2efspfbgVCGniA4DFcN6mdJ7B6zVElb0bNnUlNNaozFrl4-YgvFeNeVA0OroAoiMUF9ixnwBpOJv7M00aXVN91YgdcdnxYIHybYc40zPrB9ZqGvPw8ZeoBn7-n7G7nNngASkseoDTHWziHaHr2VnCovhETUkvZuCLurn_1oWZ22pTlZ6_RdxrP2VudZbmMtPIAYEFVrz0HDLdPUNSjau-7CB1aYfUwSyUTa5r2qIpRoMiF6IU1Tuf93.FYE_eqoF7qFCPzsPfRQT6G6WVLxYfIxHw_NEQ-30vGc&dib_tag=se&keywords=optix+anti-fog&qid=1741795363&sprefix=optix+anti-fi%2Caps%2C251&sr=8-2 "https://www.amazon.com/Optix-55-Anti-Fog-Prevents-Binoculars/dp/B07P7J48VT") are generally available and can be applied to the inside and outside of the dome bubble to provide additional protection against condensation.![anti_fog.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/21824577892877)

## Broadcast Overview

With Rhombus’ A100 Audio Gateway, organizations can capture synchronized video-audio evidence and add intelligent audio recognition to their security platform. The A100 also gives users the power to communicate through the sensor—you can amplify live messages, broadcast pre-recorded messages, and have two-way conversations.

With broadcast, you can simultaneously play the same audio message across multiple A100s at the same location. This enables you to communicate efficiently at scale throughout your organization. For added convenience, this feature is available as a module on your Dashboard—add the Broadcast dashlet for quick and easy access.

For example, you can use this feature to:

- Broadcast a pre-recorded message that your business will close in 15 minutes.
- Read live morning announcements throughout the school.
- Amplify emergency evacuation instructions across your entire organization.

_**Note: This feature requires Enterprise Licenses and will only broadcast at one location at a time.**_

## Enabling Broadcast

Broadcast can be enabled in either the Dashboard of your console, or within the Locations tab.

### Dashboard

1\. To enable broadcast on your dashboard, log into the Rhombus console and click the "Customize Dashboard" button in the top right corner under "Settings."

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/15011449006093)

2\. Next, select "Broadcast" from the drop-down next to "Dashlets" in the upper left and click "Add dashlet."

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/15012238711309)

3\. Once added, you must select a location to activate this feature.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/15012408245773)

### Locations Tab

1\. Select the tab titled "Locations" along the left toolbar.

2\. Once in the "Locations" tab, select the location you'd like to enable Broadcast.

3\. After selecting the desired location, click "Audio Gateways" along the top and click the "Open Broadcast" button.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/15014358366861)

## Utilizing Broadcast

Below is a screen recording example of utilizing Broadcast in the Rhombus console. Whether you choose to enable Broadcast via your Dashboard or the "Locations" tab, it will operate the same way.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/15056639616781)

When using Broadcast, you are given three options for what you want broadcast:

1. **Click to Talk** \- This will let you speak through multiple A100 devices through the Rhombus console.
2. **Pre-recorded Audio**\- This will allow you to broadcast an audio clip from your list of uploaded audio files. To learn how to upload audio files to your console, see our KBA titled [Audio File Management](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/10799359585805-Audio-File-Management).
3. **Record** \- This will allow a user to record audio in real-time and then have the option to preview or play it.

### Brightness

This setting affects the brightness of the image after the image is collected by the image sensor.

![Screen_Shot_2020-05-05_at_9.22.46_AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360056440151)

Figure 1.) Low brightness example on the left and high brightness example on the right.

### Contrast

Contrast affects the color contrast in the images. This is the difference between the bright and dark areas of the image. If the contrast is high, the image looks lively; conversely, if the contrast is low, the image looks flat.

![Screen_Shot_2020-05-05_at_8.50.51_AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360056437631)

Figure 2.) Low contrast on the left and high contrast on the right.

### Saturation

Saturation affects the depth of the colors in the image. The higher the saturation, the more vivid the colors will be.

![Screen_Shot_2020-05-05_at_8.52.52_AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360056437831)

Figure 3.) Low saturation on the left and high saturation on the right.

### Sharpness

Sharpness refers to the overall clarity of the image in terms of focus and contrast. A high sharpness setting will appear clear and with greater detail. While a lower sharpness setting will make the image appear fuzzier.

![Screen_Shot_2020-05-05_at_8.55.26_AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360056283732)

Figure 4.) Low sharpness on the left and high sharpness on the right.

### WDR

Wide Dynamic Range refers to high dynamic range imaging. This setting allows the camera to handle bright and dark conditions to see more detail in the black and eliminate the washed-out effect in the whites. It will also improve the quality of the freeze frame. When you play around with this setting, the effects of it may not be perceivable by the human eye in the camera player.

The following cameras support WDR: R2, R2-180, R2-LR, R100, R120, R200, and R230

![Screen_Shot_2020-05-05_at_10.17.03_AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360056290152)

Figure 5.) Low WDR on the left and high WDR on the right.

### Shutter Speed

Shutter speed determines the duration of time that light is collected by the image sensor. The brighter the scene, the more light will be collected, and the lighter the image will appear. While longer shutter speeds increase light exposure, they can also degrade video quality.

In Image Settings, you can configure the slowest and fastest shutter speeds a camera will use.  ![Screenshot 2025-05-14 at 1.50.27 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36617989282573)

### Max ISO

ISO measures how sensitive a piece of film or digital sensor is to light—the higher the ISO, the more sensitive it is. With a low ISO, you need to use a longer shutter speed than with a high ISO.

![Screen Recording 2025-05-14 at 1.46.38 PM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36617920625805)

### Exposure Level

Exposure is the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor. Adjusting the exposure level can brighten or darken an image. Below is a GIF of changing the level from low to high.

The following cameras support Exposure Level: R170, R400, R500, R510

![Screen Recording 2025-05-14 at 1.43.06 PM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36617791506829)

### Exposure Metering

Similar to exposure level, exposure metering allows you to focus the exposure level on a specific location of the video feed. In the GIF below, the exposure metering setting is set to the upper left corner and then changed to the lower right corner. This change causes the dark lower right corner to brighten up.

The following cameras support Exposure Metering: R120, R170, R200, R230, R360, R500, R510, R520, R600

![Screen Recording 2025-05-14 at 1.40.39 PM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36617690996877)

| 1\. [Navigate to Settings](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043121171-Camera-Image-Settings#h_01HT090JH99YM0FBDM08010KWR) for a device. |
| 2\. Click on "Camera Settings." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-05-14 at 8.59.56 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36607299776269) |
| 3\. The following menu of options will appear: |
| ![Screenshot 2025-05-14 at 9.02.30 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36607297185677) |

Within the settings, you can manage [bandwidth](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038029191-Understanding-Bandwidth-Ports-etc#localrecording) consumption as well as max bitrate to adjust bandwidth consumption and onboard storage.

### Digital Zoom & Rotate

These settings will allow you to change the recording field of view by zooming in up to 75% of the image or rotating the picture 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. As you rotate or zoom, the same aspect ratio and resolution will be retained.

![Screen Recording 2025-05-14 at 9.04.26 AM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36607498017549)

### Activity Region

This feature is also known as geofencing. This allows you to draw polygons on the recording view to include or exclude indexed motion events from the field of view. This feature is useful in situations where there is constant motion, due to things like a freeway or street, that you want to be excluded from triggering an event. There are two radio buttons for either triggering or not triggering alerts within the region.

![Screen Recording 2025-05-14 at 9.09.33 AM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36607769224077)

### Privacy Region

This allows one or more partial regions to be completely excluded from recording and motion events. As you use this, you will see a black rectangle appear on the view. An example of when this feature is useful is to exclude computer monitors from being recorded. You can have up to 2304 (64x36 squares) privacy regions if you so choose. To delete a privacy region, click on the created region.

![Screen Recording 2025-05-14 at 9.12.58 AM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36607737841805)

### LED Lights

This controls the LED status lights that the camera emits while in operation. This will not interfere with recording. We recommend that these stay ON for any troubleshooting purposes that may arise.

![Screenshot 2025-05-14 at 9.16.00 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36607774851725)

### IR LED

This controls the IR LED, which is turned on in night mode. The default is AUTO, which automatically turns on the LED when the night vision filter threshold is reached. AUTO is the recommended mode unless the camera IR LED needs to always be turned on or off for your use case.

### IR Filter

The IR filter controls whether you want the filter to automatically turn on and off the IR LED when it gets dark enough. The default is AUTO.

### Resolution

The amount of detail that the camera can capture is called the resolution, and it is measured in pixels. The more pixels a camera has, the more detail it can capture, and the larger pictures can be without becoming blurry or "grainy."

![Screen Recording 2025-05-14 at 9.16.47 AM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36607957526669)

### Max Bitrate

**Note**: Changing this setting will affect the total days of retention for onboard storage.

A higher bitrate setting will affect the quality of the video and, therefore, affect the amount of video being stored. Additionally, higher motion and activity in the scene will increase the video segment size, so the max bit rate limits the maximum quality the video can achieve when there is a lot of activity.

![Screenshot 2025-05-14 at 9.21.08 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36607957528461)

### Focus Region

When auto-focus is enabled, the camera will automatically focus whenever the zoom or focus region is changed. You can select a region of the image to focus on via the “focus region” button. The auto-focus algorithm performs best with a focus region that has enough complexity and edges to focus on. By default, the focus region is a rectangle in the center of the camera view.

When in edit mode, you can click and drag your cursor to select the area of interest. Once you are done, click "Save," and you will see the camera go through the focus cycle. It may take up to 20 seconds for the camera to adjust the view depending on the size of the focus region. During this processing time, the controls will be grayed out, and further adjustments will be unavailable.

The following cameras support Focus Region: R230, R400, R500, R510, R520, R600

![Screen Recording 2025-05-14 at 9.34.29 AM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36609438645005)

### Motor Zoom

The motorized zoom remote controls the lens inside the camera so that you can carefully focus the image. This feature should be used only if the software is having difficulties auto-focusing to your desired region. This process may take 5-10 seconds as the camera adjusts the view. During this processing time, the controls will be grayed out, and further adjustments will be unavailable.

The following cameras support Motor Zoom: R230, R400, R500, R510, R520, R600

![Screen Recording 2025-05-14 at 1.26.39 PM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36617314240525)

### Motor Focus

If you have "Auto Focus" disabled, you can control the focus manually. Although auto-focus is the simpler option, we wanted to give you complete control over the camera. For situations that require a manual focus, this comes in handy.

The following cameras support Motor Focus: R230, R400, R500, R510, R520

![Screen Recording 2025-05-14 at 9.58.41 AM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36609434414477)

### Motor P-Iris

Precise-Iris allows you to precisely control the positioning of the iris opening. In outdoor surveillance situations, you may want to control the amount of diffraction to adjust for blurring or get a clearer image for analytics. This process may take 5-10 seconds as the camera adjusts the view. During this processing time, the controls will be grayed out, and further adjustments will be unavailable.

The following cameras support Motor P-Iris: R400, R500, R510, R520

## Quick Overview

We need credentials (Access Key and Secret Key) for a user that has permission to PutObject to an S3 Bucket. After setting up the AWS user, policy, and bucket, enter the access key, secret key, and bucket name in the AWS integration settings page ( [https://console.rhombussystems.com/settings/integrations/awsSettings](https://console.rhombussystems.com/settings/integrations/awsSettings)).

## Cloudformation Template

In the Aws integration settings page, we have included a button that will download a Cloudformation template that you can use to create the infrastructure required for this integration in your AWS account. The template creates an S3 bucket and a new User with a policy that allows only PutObject access for the newly created bucket. The template will output the bucket name, access key, and secret key required for setting up the integration. Feel free to modify the template to fit your organization’s naming schemes, but we recommend that the user policy is left as is since it is the most restrictive policy allowing our integration.

### How to Use the Template

To use Cloudformation with this template follow the steps below:

1\. Go to your AWS console and find the Cloudformation service.

2\. Click Create Stack and choose the upload template to S3 option to upload the Rhombus template.

![image1-17.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360016579372)

3\. After choosing the template file, hit next and enter a stack name on the next page.

![image2-19.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360016579352)

4\. On the Options page, you can optionally enter tags, permissions, triggers, and alarms.

- Note: Default options should work fine, but make sure that the IAM role that Cloudformation uses allows for S3 bucket and IAM User creation.

5\. Click Next when finished.

- Note: On the Review page, there may be a check box to approve the Capabilities of this template.

6\. Because the template creates a User, you will have to check the acknowledgment checkbox and then click Next.

![image3-21.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360016631691)

7\. Finally, click the create button and Cloudformation will attempt to create the stack with the template.

- Note: Clicking on the Stack will take you to a page where you can monitor the progress.

![image4-23.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360016631711)

## Output Use and Final Steps

Once the stack creation has finished, the required inputs to the AWS integration settings page in the Rhombus console will be shown under the Outputs tab. With these, use the steps below to complete the setup:

1\. Enter the Outputs in the corresponding boxes on the [AWS integration settings page](https://console.rhombussystems.com/settings/integrations/awsSettings).

2\. Make sure that the integration is enabled and click Save.

![image5-25.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360016579392)

Now, in the Rhombus console, save a clip and you should see it appear in the S3 bucket automatically!

## Camera Features

### Color Search ![mceclip3.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404481488909)

Color Search allows users to search historical footage for specific clothing and vehicle colors, making it easier to pinpoint specific people or vehicles without scrubbing through hours of footage.

This expedites searching for specific footage when you remember only a few key details. With Color Search and the other Rhombus search tools, such as Event Thumbnails and Region Search, you can find highly specific footage with only a few clicks.

![Color Search.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26875626244109)

To see how to enable this feature, scroll to the [Enabling Features](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404466850957-Console-Features-Licensing#h_01F9Z1M5N5QQFAH4VJJ2W9Z0R4) section below.

### Face Recognition ![mceclip4.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404489398669)

This feature allows the camera to detect faces that pass by its field of view. The success of this feature is heavily dependent on the camera [mount](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048246251-Optics-and-Object-Distances-for-Analytics) and how much detail can be seen of a person. A general rule of thumb is that "if a face is not easily identifiable by a human, then it will not be recognized by the camera." Our facial recognition works by first identifying a human, taking a screenshot of the human, and then searching the cropped image for a face. To learn more about managing this feature, visit [Managing Facial Recognition.](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000327872-Managing-Facial-Recognition)

![Face Recognition.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26875626257933)

### License Plate Recognition (LPR)![mceclip5.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404481779981)

This feature enables cameras to recognize license plates as they pass through their field of view and log the plate into the console. Like Facial Recognition, License Plate Recognition heavily depends on the camera used and its [mounting positioning](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048246251-Optics-and-Object-Distances-for-Analytics). The general rule of thumb is that "if the vehicle is not easily distinguishable by a human, then it will not be recognized by the camera." LPR works similarly to Facial Recognition: the camera first identifies a vehicle, takes a screenshot of the vehicle, and then searches the cropped image for a license plate. To learn more about LPR, check out our other article, [Managing License Plate Recognition.](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037762212-Managing-License-Plate-Recognition-LPR-)

![LPR.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26875821528589)

### People Counting ![mceclip6.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404489453325)

This feature monitors how many people pass by a camera's field of view. Knowing how many people pass by is useful for situations like making sure a space is completely empty, tracking the number of employees coming into the office, and so on. To learn more about the different types of people counting, check out [this article](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002258451-Types-of-People-Counting).

![mceclip0.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404537304973)

### PPE Detection ![mceclip7.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404481882125)

Lack of Personal Protection Equipment (masks and helmets), PPE for short, can be detected using Rhombus cameras as well. Like Face Recognition and LPR, the success of this feature is heavily reliant on camera model and placement. To learn more about PPE detection check out our [PPE detection](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055084351-Personal-Protective-Equipment-Detection) article. ![Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_3.10.02_PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/18562036542477)

### Vehicle Counting ![mceclip9.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404489506957)

The vehicle counting feature is useful for monitoring vehicle traffic. Like most other features, the success of this feature is dependent on camera model and placement. For example, the GIF in the LPR section above is an R500 aimed at our HQ south entry, so that the camera can easily pick up vehicle movement.

![mceclip3.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404557342861)

Above is an example of our Vehicle Counting chart. At the bottom of this chart are buttons that show or hide vehicle counting data pertaining to cameras with this feature enabled.

### Visual Tamper Detection ![mceclip10.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404489716621)

This feature is extremely useful for detecting when the camera has been visually tampered with, like when someone covers the dome with spray paint. The way this feature works is it will use the full view of the camera window as a reference and when it becomes "covered" the system will flag and mark the detection time. All of our Rhombus Cameras have the ability for visual tamper detection.

![mceclip4.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404557578125)

### Included Cloud Archiving ![mceclip4.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4804288651917)

This feature comes with enterprise licensing and allows you to automatically back up 30 days of footage to the cloud.

### Additional Cloud Archiving ![mceclip4.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4804288651917)

This feature allows you to back up a certain number of days (30, 60, 90, 180, and beyond) and can be purchased independently from an enterprise license. To enable enterprise licenses, click the blue manage button (below), which is located at the top of the "License and Features" page. Then you will be able to assign the licenses to the cameras.

![mceclip5.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4804402001293)

### Timelapse ![mceclip6.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4805887007245)

This feature allows you to start creating a timelapse from a camera's recording. You can start this when the feature is enabled. Please see [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026648752-How-do-you-create-a-timelapse-video-) for how to create one.

## Audio AI Analytic Features

Having a designated audio device means you can process richer audio so that you can do more analytics! The A100 currently has 4 different audio capturing analytics and they are listed below.

_**Note:** Please visit [this](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404880101261-Audio-Gateway-Walkthrough) article for a full walkthrough of the A100._

### Loud Sound Detection ![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26728088889869)

The A100 can alert you based on whether a loud sound is heard or not. We use [LUFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LUFS) for this measurement and you can control how loud of a sound you are aiming to track with the slide bar (pictured below)

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26728088896653)

### Tamper Detection ![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26728088906125)

A built-in accelerometer in the A100 can help notify you when it is being tampered with. The sensitivity of this sensor can be configured through Rhombus Support, so please reach out if you need it tuned!

### Glass Break Detection ![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26728088915213)

The A100 is equipped to detect if glass is broken near it. If the sensor is placed 6-20 feet from windows, it can alert you if they are ever broken.

### Smoke Alarm Detection ![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26728104400397)

The A100 can detect the same frequency emitted by smoke alarms, alerting you when they go off. Place the A100 within a 6-20 foot distance for this detection.

### Carbon Monoxide Alarm Detection ![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26728104404621)

Like smoke alarms, the A100 can detect the same frequency emitted by carbon monoxide alarms. This allows you to notify the correct personnel when the alarm goes off. Place the A100 within a 6-20 foot distance for this detection.

## Bandwidth

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![mceclip2.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404481397645) | ![mceclip1.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404481375245) | ![mceclip0.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404481328653) |
| **Low** | **Medium** | **High** |

**Low** means that not much bandwidth is being used for these features.

**Medium** means that the amount of bandwidth used is more noticeable than low features but less expensive than computationally intensive features.

**High** means that the feature is very computationally expensive and requires a lot of bandwidth to complete.

Below is the chart with Feature and Storage bandwidth usage:

![mceclip0.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404931496461)

These symbols are set based on how much bandwidth a feature "normally" uses. The amount of bandwidth used is variable and is dependent on the setup (camera placement, max bitrate, resolution, etc.). For example, if a camera has face recognition enabled and is placed in a low-traffic area, the amount of bandwidth that would be used will be low rather than medium, as noted in the above table. However, taking the same example, if you wanted to be alerted when an unknown face is captured, then a clip would be uploaded, and you would be notified every time an unidentified face was seen. This would increase the bandwidth used by the face recognition feature. To dive more into bandwidth, check out our [Camera Bandwidth](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038029191-Camera-Bandwidth) article.

**Disclaimer**

Your bandwidth usage may be exceeded when multiple high-bandwidth features are enabled in conjunction with cloud archiving. This section of our Camera Bandwidth article shows approximately how much bandwidth is used during streaming. If you are streaming 3 cameras with color search enabled and only have a 5 Mbps upload, that could eat up most of your bandwidth.

## Night Vision Overview

Night vision is a camera feature that uses infrared light to illuminate an otherwise dark/low-light environment. During night mode, the camera image is black and white. Night vision can be configured in the console within the [camera and image settings](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043121171-Camera-Image-Settings#h_01F8G7924GTWD52R9EEFR5R2Y4). To learn more about camera IR ranges, visit our article on [Optics and Object Distances for Analytics](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048246251).

## Enabling/Disabling Night Vision

Only certain modes are supported when altering night vision settings. Please consult the table below for more details.

![Screenshot 2025-02-13 at 2.18.59 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34272149987853)

- If the issue is still not resolved, please contact [Rhombus Support](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/17769673612813-Troubleshooting-Night-Vision#h_01HCG5E927A0YSHDYSMWECS3ZM).

### Camera Image Quality Degraded When in Night Mode

- IR light may be reflecting back into the camera.  - Ensure the camera isn't mounted too close to a surface that can reflect IR light or another light source.

### Camera Image is Blurry When in Night Mode

IR light can reflect off obstructions on or inside the dome, causing bright spots in the image at night.

- Ensure there isn't condensation in the camera dome.  - [Preventing Condensation in Dome Cameras](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020141532#h_01HGGS7HKHW4TJB95DPJFEME3A)
- Ensure there are no fingerprints or other smudges/dust collected on the dome.  - Carefully clean the dome with a soft and clean lint-free cloth or a non-abrasive alcohol wipe.
- If in a high wind/weather location, ensure the dome is cleaned regularly.

  - Recommended to clean the dome quarterly with a soft and clean lint-free cloth to avoid the buildup of dust and dirt.

### Camera Image is Solid Black

- [Remotely reboot the device.](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018569731-How-do-you-remotely-reboot-a-camera-)
- Ensure there is nothing obstructing the light sensor.
- Ensure all cabling is in good condition and there are no signs of water damage in the pigtail.
- Ensure the light sensor is aligned properly and not blocked by the dome, specifically with the R360. See the following article for dome alignment:  - [Mounting a New Rhombus Camera](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051360951-Mounting-a-new-Rhombus-camera#h_01FGW46W687022WMTM1MEC5JD9)
- For R500/R510s, navigate to the device "Camera Settings," disable Auto-Focus, set Motor P-Iris to max, and adjust camera brightness. If these steps don't fix the issue, contact [Rhombus Support](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/17769673612813-Troubleshooting-Night-Vision#h_01HCG5E927A0YSHDYSMWECS3ZM).

## Inner Range

Inner Range's integration combines the third party door controller with the Rhombus Console, allowing you to remotely control doors and monitor security events in real time. With this integration, you can:

- Lock/Unlock doors remotely, using any device from the Rhombus Console.
- Track door open events, including timestamps and alerts if a door is left open.
- Monitor badge usage, receiving alerts if a badge is used but the face captured by the camera doesn’t match the badge holder.
- Integrate visual context from Rhombus and instantly search door open events with markers in camera feed timelines for badge-ins.

## Overview

Rhombus cameras need both power and an internet connection to reach Rhombus’ servers. With a few exceptions, Rhombus cameras use PoE (Power over Ethernet) to receive both power and a data connection over the same cable.

## Power the Ethernet Switch

### PoE Requirements

The camera model will determine which type of switch is required, PoE, PoE+, or PoE++. Please review the specs of the model to determine which switch is required. Most cameras require that the connected switchport supports 802.3af (PoE) up to 15.4W. Some newer models of existing cameras will require 802.3at (PoE+) up to 30W, and the R600 requires 802.3bt (PoE++) up to 60W.

Ensure your switch has a PoE budget that is greater than or equal to the number of expected cameras that will be connected. In the calculations below, we use the maximum power consumption for each camera to ensure the power draw will never exceed the PoE budget of the switch.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PoE Example (15W)** | **PoE+ Example (30W)** | **PoE++ Example (60W)** |
| Using 4 cameras, at up to 15W per camera. | Using 4 cameras, at up to 30W per camera. | Using 4 cameras, at up to 60W per camera. |
| 4x15=60W total. Ensure the switch has 60W of available PoE budget. | 4x30=120W total. Ensure the switch has 120W of available PoE budget. | 4x60=240W total. Ensure the switch has 240W of available PoE budget. |

Table 1.) PoE budget calculations are based on the maximum power consumption for each port.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Camera Model** | **PoE Requirement** | **Power Consumption (Max)** |
| R120 | PoE (802.3af) | 10.5 watts |
| R170 | PoE (802.3af) | 4.8 watts |
| R200 | PoE (802.3af) | 10.5 watts |
| R230 | PoE (802.3af) | 9.4 watts |
| R360 | PoE (802.3af) | 9.9 watts |
| R400 | PoE (802.3af) | 11.7 watts |
| R500 | PoE (802.3af) | 13 watts |
| R510 | PoE (802.3af) | 13 watts |
| R520 | PoE (802.3af) | 7.5 watts |
| R600 | PoE++ (802.3 bt) | 51 watts |

Table 2.) Specific PoE requirements per model with their max power consumption rating. For more information on each model, please visit its product page on the [Rhombus website](https://www.rhombus.com/cameras/). For power information on any models that are no longer being sold, please contact support.

### Plug in the PoE Switch

- Connect the PoE switch to a power outlet using the included power cable.

- Ensure the power indicator light on the switch is on. This confirms the switch is powered up and operational.

- Verify the switch is connected to the internet.

## Configure the Network

### Create a Dedicated VLAN

While not required, Rhombus recommends creating a dedicated VLAN for the cameras. This step can greatly simplify the troubleshooting process, and make DHCP configuration easier. If access control lists are utilized between VLANs, port 8000 should be accessible to other VLANs that intend to view footage over the LAN.

### Configure a DHCP Server

Rhombus cameras are designed to obtain their local network configuration (IP, subnet, gateway, etc.) via DHCP.

If using an optional VLAN, Rhombus recommends configuring a dedicated DHCP pool assigned to the dedicated VLAN the cameras are attached to.

If you require fixed IP addresses, you can do this on the DHCP server using DHCP reservations by matching a reserved IP address with a camera’s MAC address. Please review this article on [Assigning a Static IP Address](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027384692-Assigning-a-Static-IP-Address) for more details.

### DNS Hostname Resolution

The cameras all require access to DNS servers that can resolve hostnames ending with the suffixes rhombussystems.com and rhombus.com. Many networks are using DNS-based security solutions, such as Cisco Umbrella, to prevent cameras from accidentally accessing untrusted resources. We require that all rhombussystems.com and rhombus.com DNS hostnames be whitelisted.

### Firewall Configuration

Our cameras are designed to blend in with other devices on the network, so there is no need for any special rules. All network traffic is outbound, which means there is no need for inbound port forwarding.

Rhombus cameras use standard ports and protocols such as HTTPS/443, DNS/53, and NTP/123. If these ports and protocols are not already in use, they may need to be allowed in your firewall configuration.

Our client and servers have fully mutually authenticated TLS, which means that any security appliances configured to man-in-the-middle SSL traffic will cause the cameras to drop the connection. To avoid this, we require that any such appliance ignore traffic that includes an SNI header for any domain that ends with rhombussystems.com or rhombus.com.

#### Outbound Rules

If your Rhombus cameras connect behind a restrictive network, you will need to configure your firewall with the following rules to allow them to function.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Rule** | **Protocol** | **Port** | **Description** |
| Allow | TCP | 443 | HTTPS |
| Allow | TCP | 8443 | HTTPS |
| Allow | TCP & UDP | 53 | DNS |
| Allow | UDP | 123 | NTP |

#### LAN Streaming Rules

If you access cameras over a LAN, you must ensure you have routes set up to the camera's local subnets from the subnets where they need to be viewed on the LAN.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Rule** | **Protocol** | **Port** | **Destination** |
| Allow | TCP | 8000 | 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 |

#### Content Filtering URL Allow List

If your firewall utilizes a content filter or URL deny list, the following URLs must be added to an allow-list for the cameras to function.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Rule** | **URL** |
| Allow | \*.rhombussystems.com |
| Allow | \*.lan.rhombussystems.com |
| Allow | \*.dash.rhombussystems.com |
| Allow | \*.rhombus.com |
| Allow | \*.lan.rhombus.com |
| Allow | \*.dash.rhombus.com |

### Troubleshooting the Network

- Reboot the switch.
- Verify all cabling.
- Ensure the switch is able to access the internet. Plug in a laptop and try accessing the internet from that device to test connection.
- Check IP address conflicts and ensure all devices are being assigned an IP address.

- Check if your router or firewall is blocking the camera’s ports. Adjust the firewall settings accordingly.


## Connect Camera to the PoE Switch

### Connect Ethernet Cables to the Cameras

- Plug one end of an Ethernet cable into the camera’s Ethernet port. Ensure the cable is securely attached.

- Plug the other end of the cable into one of the PoE ports on the switch.


### Troubleshooting Methods

- **Check the PoE Port:** Make sure the camera is plugged into a PoE-enabled port. If another Rhombus camera is working on a different port, try connecting to that port to see if the camera comes online.

- **Try a Different Cable:** Ethernet cables can fail, so test the cable by replacing it with a known working one.

- **Inspect the Camera:** Ensure the camera is functional by testing it in a different location or on a different switch.

- **Confirm the camera has power and connection:**


  - Most PoE cameras will power on as soon as the Ethernet cable is connected and the PoE switch supplies power.

  - If the network and switch are set up properly, the device should also show connected to Rhombus servers and begin registration.
  - Check the camera’s LED status to confirm it is receiving power and connection.

## Unregistered Devices

Below are diagrams for our cameras, sensors, readers, and audio gateway. All Rhombus devices are currently pre-registered to your account. If you have opted out of device pre-registration, you can register Rhombus devices via the Rhombus app or the Rhombus console QR code.

**Note:** The Rhombus A100 has the same LED statuses as the R120/R170/R200.

## SD Card Related Lights

If both IR LEDs are ON, and/or the IR filter clicks, there is an issue with the SD card seating or formatting.

- If the SD card is accessible (dome cameras only) power down the camera, carefully reseat the SD card, and power back on.
- Contact Support if reseating doesn't resolve the issue, or it is a different device model.

## Troubleshooting

Below is a list of steps to take if the cameras cannot be pinged.

1. Unplug the device and plug it back in.
2. Check all cables, ports, and switches.
3. Check your network to see if the required ports are open.
4. Check to see if you have the most up-to-date browser or mobile app.
5. Open a support ticket with Rhombus.

## Alarm Monitoring Overview

Alarm Monitoring is a service that pairs with your Rhombus devices, allowing you to implement alert policies and an emergency contact list at a single location. In case of a human movement or door event trigger, an agent at one of our Five Diamond, UL-Listed Central Monitoring Centers will use video [verification](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/7717785765133-Alarm-Monitoring-Guide#h_01JFGK00Q8Z3F2BHNNNDSVA8FQ) to confirm active threats to a person or property.

If an emergency is verified, the agent will text and call your emergency contacts and dispatch authorities as needed. Agents can share location and live video streams for additional context and rapid response.

For more information, please review the [Monitoring Services Agreement](https://legal.rhombus.com/end-user-tos/monitoring-services-agreement).

**Note:** This service is intended for customers who want added security during off hours without the need for dedicated personnel.

## Set Up Alarm Monitoring

Alarm Monitoring must be set up in the Rhombus web console.

The setup for Alarm Monitoring consists of:

- Adding Alarm Monitoring licenses
- Establishing the monitoring schedule and which cameras to include in the schedule
- Create a list of emergency contacts
- Add PINs for iPad keypads
- Create first responder entry instructions

To configure to the Alarm Monitoring settings, follow these instructions:

|     |

### Alarm Central

Alarm Central is the main hub for Alarm Monitoring. On this page, you can:

- View a snapshot of verifications used.
- Pull a report of verifications used.
- Have a quick look at all devices monitored as well as associated devices.
- Use a toggle to select if monitoring will be stopped with a badge entry (available if using access control).
  - If turned on, any authorized badge entry will stop monitoring. If monitoring is on a schedule, it will turn back on at the next scheduled start time. Monitoring may be manually started at any time.
- Manually control monitoring.
  - Create custom settings for monitoring of devices.
- Monitor via a Schedule.
  - Create a custom schedule for monitoring, and select which devices will be monitored with this schedule.
  - Multiple schedules can be created, if a different monitoring scheduling is desired for different devices at that location.

### Setting Up Monitoring Schedules

When setting up Monitoring Schedules you will be presented with two options, manual or scheduled monitoring. We will go over both below.

#### Manual Monitoring

Manual monitoring has no start time or end time. This option relies solely on the individual to enable or disable the alarm. A user with proper permissions can enable/disable a monitoring event in the Rhombus web console, Mobile App and iPad Keypad.

#### Scheduled Monitoring

Scheduled monitoring starts and ends at a specific time. A user can still enable or disable the alarm monitoring via Console, Mobile App or Keypad whenever desired.

#### Setting Up Monitoring

Manual and scheduled monitoring have all the same setting features; one is enabled by a user and the other by time. Below is a run through of the sections for setting up monitoring.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24068015678733)

- Schedule - This option allows a schedule for the start and stop time of Alarm Monitoring.
- Devices - Choose the cameras for alarm monitoring
- Event Types - There are two event types, Human Movement and Door Opened (Door sensor associated with camera)
- If detected, play - This option will play an audio message (less than 10 sec) if an A100 is associated with the camera
- Play Duration - This will let audio play multiple times or after a certain amount of time
- Qualification - The first dropdown provides two options: "Is there a person present?" and "Is there a threat to person or property?"
  - This qualification determines what constitutes triggering an alarm.
- Submission - A submission delay can be configured between 0-10 mins.
  - This setting determines the amount of time between event detection and event submission to the alarm monitoring service. A delayed submission can provide you with the ample time to dismiss an event if it should not be submitted to the alarm monitoring service. This will alleviate verification volume.

### Emergency Response Contacts

In the Alarm Monitoring dropdown, select "Emergency Response Contacts."

In this section, you can add details for your organization’s emergency contacts. A default contact **must** be added to ensure someone is notified outside the hours of your custom schedule or when a custom schedule is not set.

The default contact will be contacted if there is no custom schedule or during any time period not covered by the custom schedule.

![Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 12.13.30 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35531002590605)

**Note:** If a threat is deemed valid, individuals on the contact list will be notified via text and phone call. Police will be dispatched if there is a threat to a person or property.

### Contact from Alarm Monitoring Service

The monitoring service will contact the emergency contacts from the below list of numbers:

- +1 (619)329-8928
- +1 (619)329-8846
- +1 (619)329-8736
- +1 (619)304-4016

Complete the below actions for the best user experience:

1. Add the numbers to a contact like Rhombus Monitoring so the calls aren't silenced.
2. Allow text and phone calls from Rhombus Monitoring when "Do Not Disturb" or other "Focus Mode" settings are enabled.

### Responder Entry Instructions

Responder Entry Instructions can provide emergency services with essential entry information. If responders need a key code to enter the premises or specific driving instructions to get on-site, use this field to provide them with that information. Enter the instructions and press "Save" in the bottom right.

![Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 12.17.13 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35531326068749)

### Alert Keypad PINs

The alert keypad PIN ties to the Rhombus keypad app on the iOS iPad store. To learn more, see our article on [Alarm Pad Scenarios & Installation](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/11203011962637-Alarm-Monitoring-Alarm-Pad-Scenarios-Installation). Alert keypad PINs are customizable and must be four numbers long.

## How to Use Alarm Monitoring

The Rhombus Console and Mobile App provide options to view the current status of alerts and threat cases.

### Console

In the Rhombus Console, you will see some features for how to view alarm monitoring information. One option is the 'Status' which will show location with monitoring scheduled or just amount of cameras monitored. The other feature is 'Threat Case' this will allow a user to see the list of logged events during a previous alarm event.

#### Status

There are a few ways in the Rhombus console to view the Alarm Monitoring status.

1\. Add a 'dashlet' to the Rhombus dashboard to view the amount of locations that have alarm monitoring scheduled or if there is any missing information that needs to be entered.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24073909567117)

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24149122584845)

2\. Within the locations tab you can also view the status of all the Alarm Monitoring locations. This will let you know when monitoring is scheduled to start and the option to manually start the monitoring.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24073950163853)

#### Threat Cases

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Navigate to the "Locations Tab" and select the location associated with Alarm Monitoring. |

## Live Agent Calibration Mode

Calibration Mode is used to ensure all licenses, alert policies, and contact lists are set up properly so that the customer has a seamless experience. During this one-week experience, the alarm monitoring review service will be active. They will review and verify the alerts and contact the appropriate individuals on the contact list. The customer will confirm with Rhombus that everything is working properly before disabling the test mode.

**Note:** To identify if you are in a testing mode, you will see a "Calibration Mode" banner.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24149138626701)

## Disable Alarm Monitoring with Authorized Badge Entry

With this new feature, when an authorized employee enters a location using their badge, it will automatically stop the alarm monitoring. This means the first person arriving at the building won’t need to take any additional steps to disable the alarm after entering.

If turned on, any authorized badge entry will stop monitoring. If monitoring is on a schedule, it will turn back on at the next scheduled start time. Monitoring may be manually started at any time.

Requirements:

- This feature requires specifically Rhombus Access Control and Alarm Monitoring.
- To disarm the system using a badge, users must have an authorized badge and their access grant schedule must align with the time they are trying to disarm. If there is a conflict with their access grant schedule, they will be unable to badge in or disarm the system.
- Re-arming the system is not affected by the access grant schedule. It still requires either a scheduled monitoring setup or a manual activation via the console, mobile app, or iPad app.

|     |

### Supported Third-Party Integrations

Rhombus supports certain third-party access control badge systems for use with disabling alarm monitoring via an authorized badge entry. For more information on the specific integration, please review the following documentation:

- [Avigilon Alta Integration (Formally OpenPath)](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038241431-Avigilon-Alta-Integration-Formally-OpenPath)
- [ProdataKey (PDK) Integration](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058155432-ProdataKey-PDK-Integration)

## Verification Best Practices

A “Verification” is a service-generated request for an Alert Assessment (see the [Monitoring Services Agreement](https://legal.rhombus.com/end-user-tos/monitoring-services-agreement) for more context). Each Verification triggers the transmission of a video clip to a live agent who will try and visibly “verify” whether the Alert is an active threat triggering a Notification Event or not.

Rhombus defines alarm monitoring license tiers based on the volume of Verifications that are triggered; thus, if your service triggers a high volume of Alerts requiring Verification, you will be required to purchase an appropriate license to cover anticipated volumes.

### High Verification Volume

If you have a high volume of Verifications resulting in very few (or no) Notification Events, you likely are not only paying too much for our service, but you may not have your solution configured correctly. Likewise, if you have more Verifications than your license permits, you can jeopardize a location’s license status and risk having alarm monitoring disabled for the remainder of the month.

When configuring your alarm monitoring settings, it is critical to put in the effort up-front to ensure that:

- You monitor areas identified as the highest risk, and configure your solution to avoid triggering false-positive alerts.
- You get an appreciation of the number of Verifications that will be triggered during your grace period (the initial month that you have installed the service).
- Your org does not risk deactivation from excessive Verifications.

To help avoid high Verification volumes, Rhombus recommends the following best practices:

**Device Selection**

- Choose devices for monitoring that have a good view of the area of interest and limited expected foot traffic during hours of monitoring.
- Limit the number of cameras that capture the same field of view to prevent initiating Verifications for redundant events.

**Event Selection**

- Configure for alerts that have the greatest likelihood of indicating an active threat.
  - For example: An outdoor camera that captures a lot of pedestrian traffic would trigger excessive Verifications with a human movement alert, however, a door event would only trigger an alert when there is an entry.

**Camera Activity Regions**

- Specify activity regions on cameras where you would not expect to have traffic during monitoring periods, allowing the Service to focus on the most important regions that require alerts. For more information, please see our article on [Configuring Activity Regions](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002020671-Configuring-Activity-Regions).

**Schedule**

- Select a schedule that is appropriate for your location and only monitoring when necessary. For instance, only activate the monitoring on cameras after hours, and perhaps only in public areas during periods where no human traffic is expected.

## Overview

Activity Regions allow you to highlight a region of a camera's FoV and ignore movement either within that region or outside of it. Enabling this feature helps to ensure irrelevant movement events do not prompt alerts.

## Configure an Activity Region

1\. To configure an activity region, select and open a camera's video feed.

2\. Next, hover over the three dots in the upper right-hand corner of the camera view, select the gear icon, and open "Camera Settings."

3\. Within the camera settings, select "Full" next to the option "Activity Region."

4\. Next, select whether to trigger or not trigger alerts within the region you define.

- If “Only trigger alerts in defined regions” is selected, any object that overlaps the region at all is still considered and will trigger an alert.
- If “Don’t trigger alerts in defined regions” is selected, any object that is entirely contained in the region will not trigger an alert. If the object overlaps at all with the area not selected, then it will trigger an alert.

5\. With your mouse, select the outermost points of the activity region you wish to highlight. Clicking a point will place a dot and draw a line from that point to the next point you click. To complete your selection, re-select the first dot you placed when highlighting the region.

## Delete an Activity Region

1\. To delete an activity region, select and open a camera's video feed.

2\. Next, hover over the three dots in the upper right-hand corner of the camera view, select the gear icon, and open "Camera Settings."

3\. Within the camera settings, select "Partial" next to the option "Activity Region."

4\. Select the activity region and press the delete key or click the highlighted words "clicking here" at the bottom of the pop-up window.

## Prerequisites

Before you can register a Rhombus camera, you will need:

- Rhombus Console Account
- Mobile phone with downloaded Rhombus App ( [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rhombus/id1237841963))
- Camera connected to network and power
- Provided Waterproofing Kit (reference [this](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020141532-Preventing-Water-Damage) article for details on installation)

## Waterproofing

Following the waterproofing guidelines is essential to ensure your product is covered under our End User License Agreement and Hardware Warranty. Failure to complete the waterproofing steps as outlined in the product manual may void your warranty and limit our liability for related damages. For more information, please refer to our [EULA](https://legal.rhombus.com/end-user-tos/eula).

Use the included accessories to waterproof the cable connection, installing them as shown below. Ensure the O-ring is in place (and not twisted) between the pigtail and the housing, and lock the housing and pigtail together with a quarter-turn. Using an Ethernet cable without a boot or strain relief is best for fitting easily within the housing. After mounting the camera, ensure that all three dome screws are firmly tightened to prevent water ingress.

![R360_wp(edit).png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30707187620109)

R360 models have rubber O-rings on the inside and two on the outside. The below photos showcase where they are located on the camera. It's crucial to place the silica packet inside to prevent water damage.

![Screenshot 2024-10-01 at 8.33.08 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30707508423053)![Screenshot 2024-10-01 at 8.33.52 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30707508426253)

For more information on waterproofing, please visit our [Preventing Water Damage](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020141532-Preventing-Water-Damage) article.

## Connecting the Camera

To complete registration, a camera needs power and should be connected to a local network that has access to the internet. Rhombus recommends using a PoE (Power over Ethernet) switch or PoE injector to accomplish this.

- Ensure the switch has power.
- Configure the network to comply with Rhombus requirements. Please reference our [Network Setup Guide](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/6319246804237-Networking-Best-Practices) for more details on network configuration.
- Connect the camera to the PoE switch for power and ethernet. It should automatically boot up and you can begin the registration process.

## Mounting Guide

For the R360, we offer a variety of mounting accessories, which are detailed [here](https://www.rhombus.com/accessories/). We have included some pictures and insights below into the types of accessories we offer for this model.

## Registration Methods

Once you have powered up your camera and connected it to the internet, it can be registered. Ensure the camera has the correct LED status that indicates it's ready to be registered.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Camera Model** | **Connected to Rhombus Servers** | **Not Connected to Rhombus Servers** | **Registration Failure** |
| R360 | Fast Blinking Red | Slow and inconsistent Red | Slow blinking Red IR LEDs |

A full explanation of all LED statuses can be found [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/14793298069773-Device-LED-Statuses).

If the camera does not auto-register when brought online, you can register a camera from the Rhombus Mobile App or via the Rhombus Web Console.

## Mobile App

App Download: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rhombus-systems/id1237841963)

1\. Log in to the app and tap "Menu" from the home screen.

![Screenshot_20241121-164600.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35663178039693)

2\. Select "Register Devices."

![Screenshot_20241121-164606.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35663194590093)

3\. Select to register the camera via QR Code.

![IMG_4876.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35663178046093)

4\. Assign the R360 to a location. Choose "Add Location" if you need to add a new location for the device.

![IMG_4877.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35663178046861)

5\. Select Ethernet for the camera connection type.

![IMG_4878.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35663178047373)

6\. The last screen will display a QR code that you can hold up to the camera lens to finish registration. When you hear an audible click and the red IR LED's flash, you'll know the camera has accepted the QR code.

### Web Console

1\. To register a camera from the web console, go to the "Devices" tab and select "Register Cameras."

If this is the first camera you are registering, you'll need to add a location first, either during this wizard or by selecting the "Locations" tab and choosing "Add Location."

![Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 10.21.39 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35662868898445)

2\. When the registration window populates, the first prompt asks you to enter your mobile number to receive a link to download the mobile app. If you would prefer to register via the web console, you can ignore this first step and click "Next" at the bottom right.

3\. Select the location where these cameras will be registered and click "Next."

4\. Select Ethernet and click "Next."

5\. Select which roles will have access to these devices. You can choose between no access, view-only access, or full management permissions.

6\. Select a policy to assign to these cameras and click "Next." (If you would prefer to have different policies applied to multiple cameras, leave the policy selection blank.)

7\. The final screen will display the QR Registration Code. Show this QR Code to any camera that is powered and connected to the internet, and it will register accordingly.

**Note:** If you do not hear a click, try moving the phone toward and away from the camera.

## Prerequisites

Before you can register a Rhombus camera, you will need:

- Rhombus Console Account
- Mobile phone with downloaded Rhombus App ( [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rhombus/id1237841963))
- Camera connected to network and power
- Provided Waterproofing Kit (reference [this](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020141532-Preventing-Water-Damage) article for details on installation)

## Waterproofing

Following the waterproofing guidelines is essential to ensure your product is covered under our End User License Agreement and Hardware Warranty. Failure to complete the waterproofing steps as outlined in the product manual may void your warranty and limit our liability for related damages. For more information, please refer to our [EULA](https://legal.rhombus.com/end-user-tos/eula).

**Install Waterproofing Accessories**

- Use the ¾” NPT cable gland and blanking plate to seal the cable entries on the device base.
- **Both waterproofing accessories must be properly installed** in the cable entries to prevent water ingress and condensation.

**Mounting the Camera**

- Use the screws from the accessory kit to mount the camera. The screw heads are appropriately sized to seal against the small gaskets on the base of the camera.
- Tighten screws so the camera is secure.
  - Over-tightening the mounting screws can cause the gasket to rupture/tear, which can give pooling water an ingress point depending on mounting orientation.
  - Under-tightening the mounting screws will lead to a poor seal which gives water an additional ingress point.
- Do not use power tools to tighten screws; tighten by hand until the camera is secure.

**Install the Blanking Plate**

- After choosing the hole for cable entry, the unused hole must be plugged with the blanking plate.
- Insert the blanking plate into the unused cable entry hole and tighten until the gasket is fully compressed against the camera base.

**Install the Cable Gland**

- Disassemble the cable gland, pass the ethernet cable through it, and insert the cable into the camera's PoE port.
- Use the included white rubber seal on the cable gland threads to ensure a tight seal with the camera base.
- Reassemble the cable gland and tighten it until the internal rubber seal contacts the cable fully.

**Prevent Water Pooling**

- Create a drip loop in the cable to shed water before it reaches the cable gland.

**Install the Silica Packet**

- Place the silica packet inside the camera dome before final assembly. Remove the silver package around the silica packet if there is one.

## Wiring the Camera

Every Rhombus camera requires power and a network connection to register. The easiest method to achieve this is to use a Power over Ethernet (PoE) device.

### Wire Guide

The dome must first be removed to connect an ethernet cable to the R400. To remove the dome, unscrew the two screws using the included Torx tool. After removing the dome, find the PoE port next to the conduit holes.

![PXL_20220621_175556782.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/7095631385869)

Figure 1. Dome has been removed, PoE port is accessible.

## Mounting Guide

The R400 has two conduit holes, a blanking plate, and a waterproof adapter that can attach to either opening.

## Registration Methods

Once you have powered up your camera, registering a new camera can performed from the mobile app or the web console. Ensure the camera LED blinks amber indicating it is ready to register. A full explanation of all LED statuses can be found [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/14793298069773-Device-LED-Statuses).

### Mobile App

App Download: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rhombus-systems/id1237841963)

1\. Log in to the app and tap "Menu" from the home screen and "Register Devices." That will launch the registration wizard, which will guide you through the registration process step by step.

### ![IMG_4875.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35302837541901)

2\. Select the registration method labeled "Register via QR Code"

![IMG_4876.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35302837543053)

3\. Select the location where this R400 will be registered. If you haven't already, you'll need to add a location first, either during this wizard or via the Locations tab, and choose "Add Location."

**Note:** If you aren't sure where you'd like to register your camera, tap the "Skip" button in the top right. If you choose to skip assigning a location, the device will only be visible to Super Admins in your account. You can read more about Managing Locations [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009453807-Managing-Locations).

![IMG_4877.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35302831075981)

4\. Select the camera connection type: Ethernet or Wi-Fi, and tap "Next."

**Note:** The R400 does not have built-in Wi-Fi antennas, so a Wi-Fi connection requires an adapter. For more information on connecting over Wi-Fi, please click [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049435051-Wiring-New-Rhombus-Cameras). If a Wi-Fi connection is desired, the network name and password must match both case and spelling or the camera will not connect.

![IMG_4878.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35302831080461)

5\. The last screen will display a QR code, which can be shown to one or more cameras. Display the QR code to the camera (a few inches from the lens is good). When it accepts the QR code, the R400 will produce an audible click and flash the IR LEDs.

**Note:** If you do not hear a click, try moving the phone closer and further away from the camera. If the camera does not accept the QR code, ensure the R400 can successfully connect to the internet.

### Web Console

1\. To register a camera from the web console, go to the "Devices" tab and select "Register Cameras." If this is the first camera you are registering, you'll need to add a location first, either during this wizard or by selecting the Locations tab and choosing "Add Location."

![Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 9.47.52 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/33539917081357)

2\. When the registration window pops up, the first prompt asks you to enter your mobile number to receive a link to download the mobile app. If you would prefer to register via the web console, you can ignore this first step and click "Next" at the bottom right.

3\. Select the location where these cameras will be registered and click "Next."

4\. Select **Ethernet** for the camera connection type.

5\. Select which roles will have access to these devices. You can choose between no access, view-only access, or full management permissions.

6\. Select a policy to assign to these cameras and click "Next." (If you would prefer to have different policies applied to multiple cameras, leave the policy selection blank.)

7\. The final screen will display the QR Registration Code. Show this QR Code to any camera that is powered and connected to the internet, and it will register accordingly.

**Note**: If you do not hear a click, try moving the phone toward and away from the camera, or try a different camera lens.

## Camera Clone Settings

With Rhombus, you have precise control over camera settings. You can customize camera settings according to your needs, from video resolution to privacy regions, bitrate, and more. You can now adjust the settings of multiple cameras at once, saving time and effort.

When you modify a camera's configuration, you can replicate those changes and apply them to any camera of the same model. For instance, if you change the IR Filter setting of one camera to 'On,' you can easily apply that setting to other cameras of the same model.

This streamlines the process of customizing your camera settings, making it quick and straightforward.

## Prerequisites

Before you can register a Rhombus camera, you will need:

- Rhombus Console Account
- Mobile phone with downloaded Rhombus App ( [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus) or [iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rhombus/id1237841963)
- Camera connected to network and power

**Note:** This camera is designed for indoor use **only** and does not come with a waterproofing kit.

## Wiring the Camera

Every Rhombus camera requires power and a network connection to register. The easiest method to achieve this is to use a Power over Ethernet (PoE) device. For more details on wiring, see our article on [Wiring New Rhombus Cameras](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049435051-Wiring-New-Rhombus-Cameras).

## Mounting Guide

1\. Remove the dome by unscrewing the two housing screws with a Phillips screwdriver.

2\. Use the included round-head self-tapping screws to mount the camera base to the surface. When mounting to a softer material, use the included anchors.

3\. Replace the dome and tighten the housing screws with a Phillips screwdriver.

![cam170.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/8666121433741)

## Registration Methods

Once you have powered up your camera, registering a new camera can be performed from the mobile app or the web console. Ensure the camera's LED blinks green, indicating it is ready to register. A full explanation of all LED statuses can be found [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/14793298069773-Device-LED-Statuses).

### Mobile App

App Download: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rhombus-systems/id1237841963)

1\. Log in to the app, tap "Menu" in the bottom right corner, and tap "Register Devices." That will launch the registration wizard, which will guide you through the registration process step by step.

### ![IMG_4788.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34932704773645)

2\. Select the registration method labeled "Register via QR Code."

![IMG_4789.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34932704774925)

3\. Select the location where this R170 will be registered. If you haven't already, you'll need to add a location first, either during this wizard or via the Locations tab, and choose "Add Location."

**Note:** If you don't see the location you are looking for, filter the results by clicking the "filter" button in the top right. You can read more about Managing Locations [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009453807-Managing-Locations).

![IMG_4790.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34932707228429)

4\. Select the camera connection type: Ethernet or Wi-Fi.

**Note:** The R170 does not have built-in Wi-Fi antennas, so a Wi-Fi connection requires an adapter. For more information on connecting over Wi-Fi, please click [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049435051-Wiring-New-Rhombus-Cameras). If a Wi-Fi connection is desired, please ensure the network name and password match both case and spelling, or the camera will not connect.

![IMG_4791.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34932707229197)

5\. The last screen will display a QR code, which can be shown to one or more cameras. Display the QR code to the camera (a few inches from the lens is good). When it accepts the QR code, the R170 will produce an audible click and flash the IR LEDs.

**Note:** If you do not hear a click, try moving the phone closer and further away from the camera. If the camera does not accept the QR code, ensure the R170 can successfully connect to the internet.

### Web Console

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. To register a camera from the web console, go to the "Devices" tab and select "Register Cameras."<br>If this is the first camera you are registering, you'll need to add a location first, either during this wizard or by selecting the Locations tab and choosing "Add Location." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-03-11 at 1.22.27 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34930786155917) |
| 2\. When the registration window pops up, the first prompt asks you to enter your mobile number to receive a link to download the mobile app. If you would prefer to register via the web console, you can ignore this first step and click "Next" at the bottom right. |
| 3\. Select the location where these cameras will be registered and click "Next." |
| 4\. Select **Ethernet** for the camera connection type. |
| 5\. Select which roles will have access to these devices. You can choose between no access, view-only access, or full management permissions. |
| 6\. Select a policy to assign to these cameras and click "Next." (If you would prefer to have different policies applied to multiple cameras, leave the policy selection blank.) |
| 7\. The final screen will display the QR Registration Code. Show this QR Code to any camera that is powered on and connected to the internet, and it will register accordingly.<br>**Note:** If you do not hear a click, try moving the phone toward and away from the camera, or try a different camera lens. |

## Kisi Integration Guide
[Skip to main content](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039647392-Integration-with-Kisi#main-content)

In this article we will cover how to integrate Kisi with the Rhombus Console:

- [Setting Up Kisi in Rhombus](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039647392-Integration-with-Kisi#h_01GAPEKHYHNV3ZAVK3479MHQRC)
- [How to View Kisi Events](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039647392-Integration-with-Kisi#h_01GAPETK3EE1DN0CHNW1G8ZV4W)

## Setting Up Kisi in Rhombus

To enable Kisi Integration with Rhombus, you will first need to create a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) on your local PC or Mac. **Windows users need to download OpenSSL, which can be found** [here](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) or from a trusted provider.

- In OpenSSL or Terminal you will want to copy and paste the below information.

```
openssl req -out rhombus_client.csr -new -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout rhombus_client.key -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=Sacramento/O=Rhombus Systems/CN=Client Name"
```

Replace the (C=Country, ST=State, L=City name, O=Organization name, and CN=Client name) values with the appropriate values for your organization

![mceclip0.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4849943652493)

After completion, a **rhombus\_client.csr** and **rhombus\_client.key** file will be created. These files will be used in the Rhombus console and Kisi console.

1.  Open the **rhombus\_client.csr** file using a text-editor or notepad application. Once opened, copy _**all**_ the information inside the file.
2. Open the Rhombus Console and navigate to API management which can be found in settings or you can copy and paste the below address in your web browser.



[https://console.rhombussystems.com/settings/api-management/](https://console.rhombussystems.com/settings/api-management/)


In API management choose Add API Key in the upper right-hand corner. The following form will appear.

![kIsicsr.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4404955231245)

3. Paste the information from Step 1 (the **rhombus\_client.csr** file you created earlier) into the “Certificate Signing Request” box and click submit. After submission, you will be prompted with a one-time download. **Ensure that this certification and API Key is saved. This information will not be displayed again once the prompt is closed.**
4. After your CSR is approved and authorized, open API management and click Download on the right of your API key.![Screen_Shot_2023-01-25_at_11.39.18_AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/12552666428301)

5. Next, log into your Kisi account. Go to Places -> Select location -> Integrations on the bottom left-hand side.

![Screen_Shot_2023-01-25_at_11.46.07_AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/12552887400333)

- Select add integration. Next, name the integration and select Rhombus camera from the drop-down menu.

![Screen_Shot_2023-01-25_at_11.51.08_AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/12553035926029)

- In the Integration form, copy and paste the information found in the Cert that was downloaded in your Rhombus API management console. From step 4. (The **.CRT** file contents include the top and bottom rows also). This will be pasted in the "Signed Certificate" field.
- In the box labeled “Private Key” copy and paste the **rhombus\_client.key** file generated in step 1. (The .KEY file contents include the top and bottom rows also). Make sure to open this with a text editor application.
- In the box labeled "Rhombus Systems API Key" copy and paste the information from the Rhombus API key generated in Step 1 and choose Add. See the image below.

![Screen_Shot_2023-01-25_at_11.56.16_AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/12553198677261)

6\. Sign in to your Kisi console and click your name in the top right-hand corner. Go to My account -> API. Click Add API Key. A screen with your API key will come up.

![Screen_Shot_2023-01-25_at_3.02.27_PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/12558326373389)

Please copy this information down as it will not be displayed again once the prompt is closed.

To enable the Integration with Kisi, on your Rhombus dashboard, choose the Settings Icon in the top right corner. Under badge systems, choose Kisi. Select what Kisi place you wish to associate with as well as what cameras with what doors.

![Screen_Shot_2020-02-20_at_5.36.49_PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360050330631)

## How to View Kisi Events

Once you have set up the Integration between Rhombus and Kisi, you are able to see activity on your dashboard such as visitors, recent faces and more.

![rhombus_dash.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360050221792)

Under the tab "cameras" you can see live footage as well as different events that have occurred.

![rhombuscameras.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360050330691)

On this screen, you can choose what events you want to see. The different types of events correspond to different colors on the timeline. Every time a user is unlocking a door, an event of 10 seconds should start so you can see the unlock activity.

![rhombus_livefeed.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360050330711)

At the tab "saved videos" all your unlocking events should be saved. Go in here if you wish to see the footage of the unlock events.

![rhombus_savedvideo.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360050221812)

## Remote Unlock Feature

A camera that is associated with the Kisi integration has the ability to send a 'Unlock Door' signal. This will Unlock the associated door for the set time you choose on the Kisi end (Ex. 3 sec, 5 sec, etc.). After the time has expired the door will lock. This feature is located in the top left-hand corner of the camera view screen, just go ahead and click the button to activate this feature.

Here is a photo for reference below on where to find the feature.

## Wiegand

Wiegand is a technology invented in the 1970s designed for access control. It uses magnetic fields to transmit data from the credential to the credential reader. It utilizes one-way communication and only communicates from the reader to the controller. Wiegand devices are widely used in security systems because of their reliability and durability.

## OSDP

OSDP stands for Open Supervised Device Protocol. OSDP is a communication protocol developed by the SIA (Security Industry Association) to provide more secure access control communication. OSDP uses the RS-485 wiring interface to transmit data between devices. The ultimate purpose of OSDP is to link different access control devices (controllers, readers, and credentials). Rhombus Credential Readers, DR20, and DR40 use OSDP.

## Differences between Wiegand and OSDP

- OSDP is more secure than Wiegand because of its AES 128-bit encryption (required for Federal Government applications)
- OSDP supports two-way communication between the reader and controller
- Wiegand has one-way communication; it is only reader-to-controller

## DICE Matrix Console Integration

MATRIX _INTERACTIVE’s_ video monitoring software, alarm monitoring software, and event management software utilize today’s newest technologies to provide an innovative, interactive, unified platform that offers much more than basic security monitoring.

Rhombus has developed a native integration that's easy to set up and utilize in the Rhombus Console, allowing you to connect to the monitoring center of your choice easily.

## Setup the DICE Matrix Integration

To get started, you'll need [access](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000986871-Permissions-based-Role-Management-for-Users) to the integrations administration section of the Rhombus Console and the ability to [view and manage](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000986871-Permissions-based-Role-Management-for-Users) the cameras you'd like to be monitored.

**Note:** You can only set up this integration from your desktop browser.

### Activating and Generating Camera Streams

1. From the Dashboard, navigate to Settings > Third Party Integrations > Incident Management > The NEW DICE CORPORATION![2023-06DD01_17.45.59.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/16341608406541)
2. Activate by moving the toggle to the right
3. Select which cameras you would like to be monitored using the Camera Selection drop down
4. Once you've selected all cameras, click the "Create Shared Streams" button on the right![2023-06-01_17.53.19.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/16341697891341)
5. Now that you've generated your streams, you must provide a link to each stream to your monitoring partner. You can click the "Copy Link" button next to each stream and provide this to your partner of choice.

**_Note: the copy link button will only copy the code you need to provide to your monitoring partner_**

### Deactivating and Disconnecting Camera Streams

1. To deactivate and disconnect your DICE integration you'll navigate back to the DICE Configuration page in Settings > Third Party Integrations
2. Simply toggle the integration to the left to disconnect and erase the integration. A module will pop up to confirm you'd like to delete this integration setup. Choose "Disconnect".![2023-06-01_18.12.39.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/16342074320141)

## Enable Timelapse

The timelapse feature will compile thumbnails from a camera that span up to a year to create a timelapse video. This feature can only pull thumbnails from a camera after the feature has been enabled. Any recorded footage before the feature is enabled will be inaccessible. A timelapse can be created even if the previously recorded footage has been overwritten.

**Note:** The timelapse feature must be enabled using an [Enterprise License](https://www.rhombus.com/pricing/camera-license-comparison/). Footage cannot be retrieved from before the timelapse feature is toggled on.

## Onboard Storage Overview

The amount of footage stored onboard a camera depends on several factors. Generally speaking, [storage capacity](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056152331-Understanding-Onboard-Storage#h_01HTJQAF3TMJRKWYV842WEWTK1), [bitrate](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056152331-Understanding-Onboard-Storage#h_01HTJQAWF17DCZX170TKTTXXYG), [resolution](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056152331-Understanding-Onboard-Storage#h_01HTJQBKW4VYB4MM3CSAHJRGYQ), and [motion](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056152331-Understanding-Onboard-Storage#h_01HTJQC3G9KM9Q05VTKCQKQKKA) within the field of view play critical roles in determining the amount of saved footage.

To find the information presented in this article, navigate to a camera through the "Devices" page.

![Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 1.22.46 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34045957895565)

### Storage Capacity

Rhombus cameras have several onboard storage capacities listed on our [camera specs page](https://www.rhombus.com/cameras/compare-cameras/). Specific device storage capacity is listed in the "More Details" box below the player feed.

![Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 1.41.03 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34049012084237)

### Max Bitrate

This setting limits the total amount of data that can be stored and uploaded per second from the camera. To meet this setting requirement, image quality is degraded to reduce the size of the footage. For more information, see [camera settings.](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043121171-Camera-Image-Settings#camerasettings)

![Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 1.43.16 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34047148782221)

### Resolution

This refers to the total number of pixels in the footage. Higher resolutions have more pixels and require more storage space.

![Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 2.27.37 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34047672783757)

### Motion

To access motion statistics, right-click anywhere on the camera feed and select "Stats for Nerds." Camera footage is recorded and then encoded using H264, which compresses the footage based on the amount of motion from frame to frame. Thus, footage with greater amounts of motion will be larger after the compression has been applied.

It can be challenging to estimate how many days of footage can be stored on a given camera without knowing the applied settings and what the camera is looking at. If a camera is processing progressive movement (human, vehicle, etc.), it will consume more space than a device not storing movement. More movement processing reduces the number of days that can be stored within the device.

## What is Wave to Unlock?

Wave to Unlock is a touchless form of access control that allows users to wave their hand in front of the Rhombus Credential Readers (DR20 and DR40) to authenticate their assigned mobile credentials. This eliminates the need for a physical credential, such as a proximity card or key fob.

Wave to Unlock utilizes a combination of the reader's motion sensor and the phone's Bluetooth signal to obtain and process the mobile credential within a designated range of the reader. This range can be customized by an admin within the Rhombus Console.

## Enable Wave in the Console

Wave to Unlock can be enabled in the console by any user with the appropriate Rhombus administrative permissions.

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Navigate to the "Devices" page. Select the "Doors" tab across the top and click on the door you wish to enable Wave to Unlock for. |
| ![Screenshot 2025-01-07 at 9.42.44 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/33281412993805) |
| 2\. Scroll down and select "Settings," then click on the "Wave to Unlock" setting. |
| ![Screenshot 2025-01-07 at 9.45.01 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/33281412999949) |
| 3\. Toggle on "Allow this door to be unlocked with a hand wave." The toggle will turn blue when enabled. Select the Bluetooth RSSI range desired for the Wave to Unlock feature and click "Save." |
| ![Screenshot 2025-01-07 at 9.48.34 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/33281413003021) |

Every time a user uses Wave to Unlock to badge in, an index point is created on the camera's timeline and will be labeled as "Badge authorized events," "Door unlocked events," and "Door locked events."

If you want those index points to appear on the timeline, you can enable them by clicking "Manage Event Types" on the left side below the camera's timeline and then selecting the event types you want to display.

![wave to unlock.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/20726187099789)

## Compatibility and Range

Wave to Unlock works using Bluetooth technology and its range is configurable in the Rhombus Console. The range is determined by RSSI values based on Bluetooth signal strength. An RSSI value closer to 0 indicates a stronger signal required, thus a closer range to the device. An RSSI value can vary based on a multitude of factors like device type, device location (a pocket or bag), device coverings (phone case), etc. Because of this, it will be important to do some testing on your ranges to figure out what will be best for your environment and needs.

### Adjust the Range

|     |
| --- |
| 1\. Navigate to the "Devices" page. Select the "Doors" tab across the top and click on the door you wish to enable Wave to Unlock for. |

## Best Practices for Wave to Unlock

- **Enable Bluetooth on Your Phone**: Ensure your mobile device has Bluetooth enabled. You can usually do this through the phone's settings menu.
- **Enable Location**: It is recommended that the Rhombus Key App has permission to "Always" use Location by checking the app permissions in your phone's settings.
- **Keep the Rhombus Key App Running**: It's important to keep the Rhombus Key App running in the background of your phone if location is set to "while using" the app.
- **Configure User Console Settings**: You can configure users for access control within the Rhombus console. Ensure the "Allow authentication via Rhombus Key app" option under your user profile is turned on. This setting enables the Wave to Unlock feature to work with your device. The [Add User Credentials for Rhombus Key App](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/22238114934029-Add-User-Credentials-for-Rhombus-Key-App) article covers adding a new user or configuring an existing user for mobile credentials.
- **Configure User App Settings**: For Wave to Unlock to be configured, specific permissions must be granted within the Rhombus Key App. For more information, please see the "Permissions" section for either iPhone or Android in the [Rhombus Key App Walkthrough](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/24787313588749-Rhombus-Key-App-Walkthrough#h_01HRD4WR90FPDCJ7HDENZ23KVZ) article.
- **Be within Sensor Range**: For the Wave to Unlock feature to work, your mobile device must be within a certain distance from the sensor. Distance ranges are customizable in the Rhombus console by altering the RSSI value to meet your needs. For more information, please refer to the [Compatibility and Range](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/20726184867725-Wave-to-Unlock#h_01HDMH5H4MD8N0Q747ZB8NBWPH) section above. The closer the RSSI value is to 0, the closer the device needs to be to the reader to unlock. Ensure your device is within this configured proximity range when attempting to unlock a door using wave-to-unlock.
- **Approach Angle**: When you turn the corner or change direction, it can take a moment for your phone and the reader you're trying to unlock to "talk" to each other. Additionally, other physical obstacles can cause a signal blockage or strength reduction. Thick walls, metal objects, wallet phone cases, etc., can all place strain on your mobile device's BLE connection to the badge reader. Please remember that when walking to a badge reader from a blocked angle, or if there are additional obstacles that may affect BLE strength, the reader may take a few seconds to read the RSSI value and accept your credentials.

To ensure all users are set up with Wave to Unlock on their personal devices, we recommend sharing these best practices, as well as the [Rhombus Key App Walkthrough](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/24787313588749-Rhombus-Key-App-Walkthrough) article, which covers settings and app permissions.

## Batch Actions

With Rhombus, you have granular control over camera settings. From video resolution to privacy regions to bitrate, to location and beyond, you can customize camera settings according to your needs. We want to make every step of the process as simple as possible and that's why we created the Batch Actions feature. Now, you can **adjust the settings of batches of cameras** rather than making the adjustments one at a time.

### What is it?

This user-friendly console feature allows a user to select as many cameras as desired from the devices page, and mass change location or camera settings. Super users who know exactly what settings they prefer on certain camera models will now save time by batch-updating cameras instead of configuring each one at a time.

### How to use it?

To get to Batch Actions follow this simple pathway:

```
Rhombus Console > Devices > Cameras > Actions
```

Once there, you will see that this feature has two main functionalities, batch-assign locations and batch-assign camera settings.

![Screenshot](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/16750974719373)

#### Assign to Location

This sub-feature allows you to select as many cameras as needed, and mass update their location. This is a really helpful feature for scenarios like moving, especially if the current location had a large number of cameras set up. Individually updating each camera location would be very time consuming, but with this feature, it can be done in just a few seconds. After selecting the cameras and typing in the new location, press assign to save your changes.

![Screenshot](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/16750980609165)

#### Manage Camera Settings

This sub-feature also allows you to select as many cameras as needed and mass update camera adjustments such as shutter speed, max ISO, brightness, and much more as shown below:

![Screenshot](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/16750965406349)

Manage Camera Settings is intuitive and user-friendly as it displays all the cameras you select and groups them by model, without limiting the ability to mass assign them. After you're done applying your changes, press the Save All Changes Button.

### Alternative Ways to Batch Assign

There is another way to batch-assign camera features, to get to that, please follow the pathway below:

```
Rhombus Console > Devices > Camera > Camera Settings > Edit Multiple Cameras
```

After pressing this option, you will be taken to the window below and can choose from cameras of the same model.

![Screenshot](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/16753898092045)

After selecting the cameras, press the save option, and you will see an editing camera banner above the camera settings. The screenshot is below:

![Screenshot](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/16753898094733)

This way of batch assigning takes a few extra steps and only lets you batch assign cameras that are the same model. Because of that, we highly encourage you to use the Batch Action feature described above instead, it gives you more flexibility and will allow you to save the most amount of time.

## Overview

Rhombus devices require licenses to utilize all their available features in the Rhombus ecosystem. This article will cover the steps to claim your license key once you have purchased device licenses.

## Claim Your Key

1\. To claim your license key, begin by opening the email sent from [shipping@rhombus.com.](mailto:shipping@rhombus.com)

2\. Copy the claim key in the email and click "Claim License Key." This button will open a separate tab on the License Management page in your Rhombus console.

**Note:** If you are not already signed into your console, you will need to do so in this step.

3\. On the License Management page, paste your copied claim key in the input field in the upper-right corner of the page and click "Claim Licenses."

![Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 1.07.22 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/34073294175885)

4\. Next, a window will appear outlining the licenses you are claiming and their start and end dates. Click "Redeem" to complete claiming your licenses.

![Screenshot 2025-01-10 at 4.37.37 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/33482673889805)

**Note:** The start and end dates are determined by the type of licenses purchased (e.g., 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, etc.). If a license is applied to a device before its scheduled start date, the license will begin on the date it is applied, not the originally scheduled start date. The licenses in a claim key will always begin on whichever date comes earlier, the scheduled start date or the date a license is applied.

## Apply Device Licenses

Once your claim key has been redeemed, you may want to apply the license(s) to a device in your console.

1\. Navigate to the "Devices" page and select the device to which you want to apply the license. Click "Add License."

![Screenshot 2025-01-14 at 5.03.04 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/33487365888141)

2\. Next, a window listing the available licenses for this device will appear. Click the checkbox next to the license you wish to apply and click "Save" in the bottom right corner.

![Screenshot 2025-01-14 at 5.05.24 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/33487391960589)

3\. Once a license has been applied, every license in that claim key will begin its timer.

## Floor Plans

Floor plans are located in the Locations tab of the Rhombus Console. After you have registered all your Rhombus devices, you can upload a floor plan to help you visualize where all your devices are physically located.

This step is also critical if you are using T1 asset tags as they rely on the placement of the cameras on the map to calculate their position.

There are no size restrictions and the supported formats for uploads are: bmp, jpg, png, and gif.

![mceclip1.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4410143885069)

## Upload a Floor Plan

In the Location of your choice, you will see an 'Upload Floor plan' button. This will bring up a modal that will prompt you to upload your own floor plan.

![Screen_Shot_2020-06-08_at_12.04.36_PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360058991592)

Once you've selected your floor plan, it will upload to the map.

![floor-plan-cover.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360058985792)

## Repositioning Rhombus Devices

In the Location of your choice, you will see an 'Reposition Devices' button. This will bring up a modal that will have your floor plan with your devices. At this step, the devices become selectable and you can move drag and drop then where you want them to be.

![Screen_Shot_2020-06-08_at_12.13.41_PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360059152211)

During this step, you can also change the cameras direction by simply clicking on the directionality beam and rotating it around the camera.

## Registering T1 Sensors
[Skip to main content](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038529792-Registering-the-T1#main-content)

Topics included in this article:

## Prerequisites

Before registering your T1, you'll need to be in range of a BLE enabled device that is registered to your Rhombus Console. You will also need to be signed into the Rhombus mobile app ( [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rhombus-systems/id1237841963)).

## T1 Asset Tag

To register your T1, turn the sensor over and press the black dot after the word "contains." This will put the sensor in registration mode. A green dot will begin pulsing to indicate the sensor is ready to be registered (as seen below). The sensor will stay in registration mode for 2 minutes before going to sleep.

Next, open your mobile app and select 'Register Devices.' To finish, toggle the buttons next to sensors you'd like to register and tap 'Next' at the bottom of your screen.

![asset_tag.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360047509091)![Register_Sensors.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360047385772)

## Unregistering a Sensor

You can only unregister sensors from the mobile app. To do so, you will need to be connected to the same network as the sensor you want to unregister.

1\. Open the mobile app and tap 'Devices.'

2\. Scroll down and tap 'Utilities.'

3\. Tap 'Unregister Sensors.'

4\. Select the sensors you want to unregister and complete the process.

## What is Occupancy Counting?

Occupancy counting allows end users to meticulously track human traffic at pivotal business locations. This feature yields indispensable data, enabling users to optimize business performance, maintain a secure environment, and identify key traffic trends.

## How Occupancy Counting Works

Much like our advanced people counting functionality, our occupancy counting feature initiates by detecting human movement on the camera. Depending on the configured policy, the camera will promptly issue an alert notification if the observed human occupancy surpasses the predetermined threshold within the field of view (FoV). For instance, if the threshold is set at 10 people, the camera will trigger an alert only when 10 or more individuals are present within the same frame simultaneously.

Below is a screenshot of what High Occupancy event on a Rhombus camera.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/19762543836685)

## How to Set Up

Any camera equipped to detect human movement can be effectively employed for Occupancy Counting. To activate this feature, navigate to your console settings and select 'Manage Policies.' From there, you can easily enable Occupancy Counting for the specific cameras that require this functionality.

## SSO

If your company uses a SAML provider like Okta or G-Suite, you can configure that provider to work with Rhombus to ensure greater account security.

## 2-Factor Authentication

For those who don't have a SAML provider, but still want an additional layer of login security, this method will force users to verify their identity via emailed code or via the use of an MFA application.

## Contacting Rhombus Support

If you ever feel that your account has been compromised, please [reach out to our support team](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) immediately.

## Integration Setup

The Microsoft Teams Integration allows Rhombus Systems to push alert notifications to a Microsoft Teams channel of your choosing.

**Note:** To properly configure this integration, ensure you are logged into a Rhombus Client Account.

1\. To enable the Microsoft Teams Integration, follow the path below:

```
Rhombus Web Console > Settings > Third Party Integrations > Incident Management > Microsoft Teams
```

2\. Next, toggle the slider to enable the Microsoft Teams Integration and click "Give Admin Consent." This will redirect you to the Microsoft Teams login page (you must be a Microsoft Teams administrator to complete the setup).

![Give Admin Consent.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30335854002317)

3\. Select "User Login" and click "Login with Microsoft Teams."

![User Login.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30335858659469)

4\. Once you are logged in, click the install button next to the corresponding Teams channel name and toggle "Enable Notifications" to transfer Rhombus Alerts to the respective channel(s). Perform this step as needed for each channel.

![Install Bots.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30337249840653)

5\. Click the "Configuration," toggle the slider to enable notifications for users, and click "Install Bot for user."

![Configuration.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30335858665869)

6\. Once you have installed the bot for your user, navigate to your Profile page within the Rhombus Console. Click the "Enable notifications" toggle to receive notifications in your user chat within Microsoft Teams.

![User Profile.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30335858670093)

## What does the integration do?

Intuiface is a digital experience platform that is utilized in many scenarios (such as unmanned self storage). The integration works when a human movement is seen on a Rhombus camera and then sends web hook to Intuiface. This web hook can then be used on Intuifaces end as trigger to set off a chain of events.

## Setup

To set up the integration on the Intuiface side all you will need is Intuiface API Key. This API key will be needed to use in Rhombus. _**Please contact Intuiface for how to set this up on their end. [Contact Info](https://www.intuiface.com/contact)**_

Once that part is finished you can turn on the integration in the Rhombus console by following the path below. And then simply click on the toggle to turn it the integration on.

```
Rhombus Console > Settings > Third Party Integrations > IoT Integrations > Intuiface
```

Below is a quick gif on how to turn on the integration.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/18410414531085)

After turning on the integration you will now have the ability to choose the camera, enter the Intuiface API key and parameters. Below is a video example.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/18411216535181)

## Notes

_**Please note: If you are experiencing any issues with the integration not related to cameras  detecting human movement. Please reach out to Intuiface support here. [Contact Info](https://www.intuiface.com/contact)**_

## Door Access Conditions Overview

Door Access Conditions are used to grant or revoke access for specific doors during set timeframes.

An access grant is used to specify who can access what doors and during which timeframes they will have access to use the door.

An access revocation is a one-time, non-recurring rule that revokes access for specified users and doors. They can be used in situations where users who would normally be able to access a door should not be granted access, for example, during a special event.

## Set Up Door Access Conditions

## What is Rules Engine?

Rules Engine is a feature that runs off "If... Then..." statements with the ability to customize the locations/devices where the rule is triggered and when the rule is active. Below is a breakdown of each individual segment.

- The "If" section is comprised of triggers from camera events (e.g. human movement, license plate alert), door events (e.g. door open), environmental events (e.g. high temp, low temp), and other sensor events.
- The "At/On" section refers to locations or devices that need to be tied to the "If" section triggers.
- The "During" section is the time schedule for when the rule should be active.
- The "Then" section specifies the action that will occur when the trigger occurs for the specific device/location in the selected time frame.

![Screenshot 2024-06-05 at 3.17.31 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/27333353993997)

### Example Use Case

A good use case for the rules engine is to set up a rule that warns people who trespass onto the business premises when the place of business is closed. Below is a link to one of our LinkedIn posts showing how the rules engine works for this use case.

- [Rhombus Rules Engine Example](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rhombus-systems_rhombus-physicalsecurity-smartcameras-activity-6988203846149844992-5IAO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

From the rules engine example, you can see a person walking up the building, which triggers a voice recording to be played, and the person leaves the property. This was achieved by setting a rule to be triggered by human movement on the devices outside our facility outside of business hours which then prompted a text-to-speech message to play on the nearby audio gateway device.

## Rules Engine Walkthrough

In order to enable Rules Engine in the Rhombus Console, you need to have an [A100](https://www.rhombus.com/sensors/a100/) device with an Enterprise license registered to your account and/or have our [Access Control](https://www.rhombus.com/access-control/) installed. This is required because the "Then" section of the rules engine currently only allows you to use audio clips from the A100 or to trigger AUX relays with Rhombus Access Control. Below is a walkthrough of the feature.

1\. In order to find Rules Engine, you must follow the pathway below:

```
Rhombus Console > Settings > Rules Engine
```

![Screenshot 2024-06-05 at 3.13.19 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/27333369817997)

2\. Once you have clicked on the feature, you will see a list of your existing rules as well as an "Add Rule" button in the upper left corner ![Screenshot 2024-06-05 at 3.15.59 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/27333369820173)

3\. When clicking the "Add Rule" button, a new blank rule will appear with the layout below.

![Screenshot 2024-06-05 at 3.17.31 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/27333353993997)

4\. The first thing to do is to name the rule in the "Enter rule name" section at the top. Once named, you can click the "Add Trigger" button in the "If" section of the rule, and a list of triggers will appear for you to select from.

![Snip20221118_79.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/10738957005709)

5\. Once a trigger is selected, move to the next section, "At/On," and select the devices or locations to which you want the trigger applied.

![Snip20221121_80.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/10793568898957)

6\. Once you pick the desired locations or devices, move on to the "During" section and select a schedule you want Rules Engine to follow.

![Snip20221121_81.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/10793812888845)

7\. Next, move on to the "Then" section and choose to either have an audio clip played on an A100 or to have a door relay triggered.

![Screenshot 2024-06-05 at 3.28.05 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/27333369821069)

7a. When selecting the "Play Audio" button, you will be prompted to select the audio clip you want to play when the trigger is activated from the "Play clip" drop-down as well as which A100 you would like it played on from the "on audio gateways" drop-down.

![Snip20221121_82.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/10794755447309)

7b. When selecting the "Trigger Relay" button, you will be prompted to select the access control device you would like to change the state of from the "AUX Relay" drop-down.

![Screenshot 2024-06-05 at 3.32.14 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/27333369829133)

Once the door is selected you can choose how long the relay should last as well as if the relay should change to "Active" or "Inactive."

![Screenshot 2024-06-05 at 3.32.23 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/27333369834765)

8\. Finally, press the "Save" button in the upper right-hand corner. After this, your new rule will appear in the main list on the Rules Engine page and be available to pause, edit, or delete.

## Prerequisites

Before you can register a Rhombus camera, you will need:

- Rhombus Console Account
- Mobile phone with downloaded Rhombus App ( [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rhombus/id1237841963))
- Camera connected to network and power
- Provided Waterproofing Kit (reference [this](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020141532-Preventing-Water-Damage) article for details on installation)

## Waterproofing

Use the included accessories to waterproof the cable connection, installing them as shown below. Ensure that the O-ring is in place (and not twisted) between the pigtail and the housing, and lock the housing and pigtail together with a quarter-turn. It's best to use an Ethernet cable without a boot or strain relief, to fit easily within the housing.

![R500_wp (edit).png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30708156771981)

For more information on drip loops and preventing water damage, please visit our [Preventing Water Damage](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020141532-Preventing-Water-Damage) article.

Wiring the Camera

The camera needs power and a network connection to register. For easy deployment, we recommend using a Power over Ethernet device. See [this article](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049435051-Wiring-new-Rhombus-Cameras-) for details.

With the R510, you can verify that the camera is receiving power and a network connection via the LED indicators on the pigtail attached to the camera.

![mceclip0.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/18562106847501)

## Mounting Guide

For the R500/R510, we offer two mounting accessories: a pole bracket and a junction box. A complete list of our accessories can be found [here](https://www.rhombus.com/accessories/).

### Pole Bracket

Below is a picture of the pole bracket used to mount the R500/R510. To take the top off the front plate, remove the screws and use a good amount of force to pull off the front plate. Next, remove the rubber gasket from the front hole and feed the pigtail cable through the front of the mount. Then, attach the rubber gasket to the pigtail cable and re-insert the gasket back into place. On the back of the pole bracket, you can insert the ethernet cable to connect the R510 pigtail cable.

![PXL_20220628_165727653.MP.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/7266453209357)

The two blue arrows must line up to properly reattach the front plate. See the below example.

![PXL_20220628_165657700.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/7266492868237)

### Junction Box

To take the top off the junction box, remove the screws and use a good amount of force to pull off the front plate. Next, remove the rubber gasket out of the front hole and feed the pigtail cable through the front of the mount. The second image below shows the inside of the junction box and the two cap hole options.

![PXL_20220628_165151471.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/7266522951053)

![PXL_20220628_165206968.MP.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/7266525747341)

## Registration Methods

Once you have powered up your camera, registering a new camera can performed from the mobile app or the web console. Ensure the camera has the correct LED status that indicates it's ready to be registered. A full explanation of all LED statuses can be found [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003695532-Camera-LED-Status-Meanings).

### Mobile App

App Download: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rhombus/id1237841963)

1\. Log in to the app and tap "Menu" from the home screen and then "Register Devices." That will launch the registration wizard, which will guide you through the registration process step by step.

### ![IMG_4875.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35305214989197)

2\. Select the registration method labeled "Register via QR Code."

![IMG_4876.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35305214990477)

3\. Select the location where this R400 will be registered. If you haven't already, you'll need to add a location first, either during this wizard or via the Locations tab, and choose "Add Location."

**Note:** If you aren't sure where you'd like to register your camera, tap the "Skip" button in the top right. If you choose to skip assigning a location, the device will only be visible to Super Admins in your account. You can learn more about Managing Locations [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009453807-Managing-Locations).

![IMG_4877.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35305214992397)

4\. Select the camera connection type: Ethernet or Wi-Fi, and tap "Next."

**Note:** The R500/R510 does not have built-in Wi-Fi antennas, so a Wi-Fi connection must use an adapter. For more connection information, please click [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049435051-Wiring-new-Rhombus-Cameras-). If a Wi-Fi connection is desired, the network name and password must match both case and spelling or the camera will not connect.

![IMG_4878.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35305209909261)

5\. The last screen will display a QR code. Once the camera has powered on, show the QR code to it (a few inches from the lens is good). You'll know the camera has accepted the QR code when you hear an audible click from the device and the IR LEDs flash.

**Note:** If you do not hear a click, try moving the phone toward and away from the camera.

### Web Console

1\. To register a camera from the web console, go to the "Devices" tab and select "Register Cameras."

If this is the first camera you are registering, you'll need to add a location first, either during this wizard or by selecting the Locations tab and choosing "Add Location."

![Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 9.47.52 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35305209911437)

2\. When the registration window pops up, the first prompt asks you to enter your mobile number to receive a link to download the mobile app. If you would prefer to register via the web console, you can ignore this first step and click "Next" in the bottom right.

3\. Select the location where these cameras will be registered and click "Next."

4\. Select **Ethernet** for the camera connection type.

5\. Select which roles will have access to these devices. You can choose between no access, view-only access, or full management permissions.

6\. Select a policy to assign to these cameras and click "Next." (If you would prefer to have different policies applied to multiple cameras, leave the policy selection blank.)

7\. The final screen will display the QR Registration Code. Show this QR Code to any camera that is powered and connected to the internet, and it will register accordingly.

**Note:** If you do not hear a click, try moving the phone toward and away from the camera, or try a different camera lens.

## Prerequisites

Before you can register an A100, you will need:

- Activated Rhombus Console Account
- Mobile Phone with Rhombus App installed (for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rhombus/id1237841963) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1))

- A100 connected to network and power


## Connecting the A100

The A100 needs power and a network connection to register. The easiest method to achieve this is to use a Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) device, but a solar + cellular setup is also possible for remote deployments. Please see [this](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049435051-Wiring-new-Rhombus-Cameras-) article for specifics.

Below are notes about connecting the A100:

- The gateway is only to be connected to PoE networks without routing to outside plants.
- If powered by a power adapter, the adapter must be properly grounded.
- Please contact Rhombus' certified dealers for compatible power adapters.

## Mounting on a Wall or Ceiling

Below are the steps for mounting the A100 on a wall or ceiling:

- Do not open the unit to mount; use mounting screws directly through the three exposed mounting holes.
- Use included mount template to drill holes for screws and cable.
- Use the included self-tapping screws (diameter TP4, head dia 7mm, and thread length 25mm).
- Use the included anchors when mounting to softer materials.

## Registration Steps

1\. Log in to the Rhombus Mobile App (for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rhombus/id1237841963) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1)).

2\. Navigate to the "Devices" tab by tapping the "Devices" tab icon on the bottom left.

3\. Tap the "Register Devices" button at the bottom of the "Devices" tab.

### ![register_devices.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/7295163497485)

4\. Next, select the "Register via Bluetooth" button.

![mceclip0.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/8212814441485)

5\. Select "Default" distance:

![mceclip7.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/18562059191181)

6\. Adjust which roles can access the Audio Gateway and tap the "Next" button.

7\. Select the Audio Gateway you want to register from the list of devices (the serial number should match what you see on the bottom of the device) and then tap the "Next" button.

**Note:** If you do not see your Audio Gateway, it is either already registered or is not connected properly to power and/or the internet.

8\. Adjust the internet connection type and hit the "Next" button at the bottom of the page.

9\. Then, adjust the IP configuration and tap "Next."

10\. Once completed, you will be taken to a loading page to wait for the registration to complete.

11\. When you see the success message, you can click the newly available "Done" button at the bottom of your page to finish up the registration process.

GIF of full setup:

![mceclip2.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/18562069795085)

**Note:** This setup assumes the audio gateway is connected to PoE through an ethernet cable. The Audio Gateway is a standalone, BLE, two-way audio device powered by PoE, so it can also serve as a gateway to our BLE sensors.

## Cameras

### Camera Disconnected (Possible Network Issues)

1. Check cable runs and wiring.   - Have all the cables been tested and verified?
   - If a patch cable is used, does the device come online?
   - If the cable for a known-good camera is used, does the device come online?
   - Are there any visible signs of corrosion or bent pins?
   - Try checking all the RJ45 connectors, starting at the camera and going to the switch. Mismatched wires in a cable can cause the camera to power on but not gain a connection. ![Screen_Shot_2021-03-09_at_3.52.18_PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/17527601001357)
2. Check the onsite networking setup.   - If the camera is not connecting to the internet, check the DHCP client list to see if the camera is being assigned an IP address. This information can be found in the network setup, which can be a router, PoE switch, or gateway. For larger networks, you may need to contact the network admin department. If the camera is registered, you can find the MAC address on the [device inventory page](https://console.rhombussystems.com/logs/device/). Otherwise, this information can be found on the box the camera arrived in.
   - Was there a recent power or internet outage?
     - A recent outage may sometimes require the PoE switch, or the device, to be manually power cycled.
   - Is there a firewall or other equipment after the PoE switch and before the camera that may be restricting access?
   - Are there enough IP addresses to hand out?
   - Is the camera getting an IP address?
   - If a laptop is connected to the port this camera is using, can you get to a site like [google.com](http://google.com/) or rhombus.com?
   - Please reference the following networking documents for more detailed information:
     - [Network Setup Guide](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/6319246804237-Networking-Best-Practices-)
     - [Supported Wi-Fi Network and Authentication Protocols](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013839352-What-WiFi-network-and-authentication-protocols-are-supported-)
3. At the PoE switch, plug the camera into the port of a known working camera.   - If it comes online, then there is an issue with the port configuration
   - If it still does not come online, move on to Step 4
4. Plug the camera in using the cable of a known working camera, and using the port of a known working camera.   - If it still does not come online, please [contact Rhombus Support](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/17519850914061-General-Onsite-Troubleshooting-Procedures#h_01H53G2XA8W9M3JMKWNKAYDMNX) to continue troubleshooting.
5. If the camera is a new registration, and the above troubleshooting did not get it to connect:   - Please check the SD card to ensure that is seated correctly. We recommend powering the camera down, reseating the SD card, and then powering it back up.
6. If none of these steps have brought the camera online, please contact [Rhombus Support](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/17519850914061-General-Onsite-Troubleshooting-Procedures#h_01H53G2XA8W9M3JMKWNKAYDMNX).   - Please provide them with the camera information, serial number, and troubleshooting steps taken so far. Support can then assist with further troubleshooting and resolution.

### Power Issues

If there are no LED lights, the camera may not be getting sufficient power. Check the plug connector to see if any pins are damaged and test the cables the camera is using.

1. Is the camera plugged into a PoE switch that supports the correct protocol?   - Most routers and access points do not support PoE connections.
   - Review the PoE requirements of the specific camera model.
2. Is the port on the PoE switch supplying power to the camera?   - The port will usually have a solid amber link light above or below the plug. For example, the left cable is only transferring data, the middle cable has power and data and the right cable has neither. ![ethernet_link_lights.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/17529855263245)
3. Try checking the connections and look for water damage or damaged pins.    - Discolored or burned RJ45 connectors are a sign of water damage or shorted cabling. If the connectors look like the image below, please [contact Rhombus Support](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/17519850914061-General-Onsite-Troubleshooting-Procedures#h_01H53G2XA8W9M3JMKWNKAYDMNX) with a photo and they will assist with resolution. See example below:![water_damage_R2.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/17529977074573)
4. Test a new cable or a patch cable to see if the device comes online.
5. [Contact Rhombus Support](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/17519850914061-General-Onsite-Troubleshooting-Procedures#h_01H53G2XA8W9M3JMKWNKAYDMNX) with what troubleshooting steps you have taken and any relevant photos that may assist in the next phase of troubleshooting.

### Registration

Registration issues may sometimes occur if there are issues with the SD card. Power cycle the device and ensure the SD card hasn't been accidentally dislodged.

This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8C14PUnK18) covers the general steps for replacing the SD card for several dome camera models.

1. Power down the camera by unplugging it.
2. Carefully remove the dome.
3. Ensure the SD card is properly seated. Reseat if necessary.
4. Reattach the dome.
5. Plug the camera back in to power it up.
6. Use a soft cloth or non-abrasive alcohol wipe to clean the dome to remove any fingerprints or smudges before final installation.

### Non-Recording State

1\. On the "Devices" page, look for this status message:

## What is the Timeline?

The timeline can be found at the bottom of a camera's Field of View (FOV). It allows you to search through past footage, search for events, and create clips. The timeline records all the events captured by the camera. These events are color-coordinated, and a legend stating the event type is on the bottom.

![Screenshot 2025-01-31 at 11.28.45 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/33952488049933)

## How to Use the Timeline

If you want to search through footage, click on the arrows highlighted in red below. This will allow you to navigate through past footage. The arrows will jump you either forward or backward in time, in intervals based on how zoomed into the timeline you are.

![Screenshot 2025-01-31 at 11.29.27 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/33952563091085)

## Zoom In/Out of the Timeline

If you would like to zoom into the timeline to get a more granular look at the events picked up by the camera, click on the icon with arrows pointed at each (the upper portion of the red box shown below). If you want to zoom out, click on the arrows facing opposite each other(the lower portion of the red box shown below).

![Screenshot 2025-01-31 at 11.31.00 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/33952585718157)

## Searching for a Time/Date on the Timeline

If you are searching for an event and know the exact time/date it happened, you can input that information to navigate directly to it. On the right-hand side of the timeline, you will see both a calendar and clock icon as shown in the red box below. Once you input a time and date here, the timeline will jump to that footage.

## What does our AI do for Rhombus?

The current artificial intelligence we use for Rhombus cameras helps track humans, vehicles, faces, and license plates. Our AI can identify the camera's humans, faces, vehicles, and license plates. The AI compares faces and assigns an alphanumeric value to license plates in our cloud infrastructure.

## Initial AI expectations

Some of our AI is stored/performed locally on the cameras. This means that when first registering the Rhombus camera you may experience some false positives for human or vehicle movement. If you experience a large number of false movements please feel free to reach out to the Rhombus Support team [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044534011) for better assistance with this issue.

## Properly setting up the camera for optimal AI accuracy

Below is a quick start guide for how to properly set up the camera to track particular movements and recognition for certain features. Below is a list of common tips that can be applied to the initial setup of the camera along with the expectations for AI features.

### Framing of the camera view

When mounting and setting up a Rhombus camera you should always try to eliminate all unmoved space from the camera view. The camera should be mounted parallel to the horizontal plane. [Here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051360951) is a mounting guide for Rhombus cameras So if a camera is framed on a wall, you would not want the wall to be visible or limit visibility as much as possible. Below is an example of framing of a camera view with too much of the ceiling in the picture along with a fix.

![Swag_Room-Jul_19_2022_10_26_06_AM_PDT.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/7793243457549)

Below is the same camera now adjusted to eliminate the ceiling from the frame.

![Swag_Room-Jul_19_2022_10_38_49_AM_PDT.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/7793339057933)

### Placing Activity regions

Setting up activity regions in a camera frame view helps by providing AI alerts only if the movement passes the threshold of that region. Also, setting up 'don't trigger' activity regions for areas such as bushes or any other non-human or vehicle movement that occasionally moves by environment changes. This helps improve your AI by reducing the number of false movement alerts. To learn more about activity regions see the article [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002020671).

### Human Movement

For human detection, the camera will need to be positioned in a way where most of a human body shows in the camera's frame. If you only have a single body part in the frame initially the camera will only detect an 'Any Movement'. In order for the AI to detect human or vehicle movement, a certain number of pixels in the frame have to be changed.

![Screen_Recording_2022-07-19_at_10.56.22_AM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/7794211418509)

### Facial Recognition

For facial recognition, we have a great guide [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000327872) on how to manage facial recognition in both the aspect of positioning the camera and setting up the saved faces feature. For our AI to activate the facial recognition aspect it first needs to detect a human movement, then the AI will look for a face. Then the face will be sent to the cloud to compare it to saved faces.

_Tip: We at Rhombus recommend that uploading saved faces for individuals is key to helping the AI compare the correct faces. See how to do that [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000327872-Managing-Facial-Recognition#h_01FTCEMYD2YNCYCDZM5NY2MB1J). We also recommend that you look at our [Objects and Distances page](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048246251) to better decide on what camera will accurately provide you with facial recognition._

### Vehicle Movement

For vehicle movement, you will need to have the camera positioned so that the full car enters the field of view. If only portions of the car enter the field of view this may not trigger a vehicle movement detection from the AI. In order for the AI to detect human or vehicle movement, a certain number of pixels in the frame have to be changed.

### License Plate Recognition

For license plate detection, we have a guide [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037762212) on how to better position the camera for license plate recognition and how to add view and track license plates. For our AI to activate the license plate recognition feature it first needs to detect a vehicle movement, then the AI will look for a license plate on the car.

_Tip: We at Rhombus recommend that if you want to have accurate LPR that you look at our [Objects and Distances page](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048246251) to better decide on what camera will accurately provide you with license plate recognition._

**Note:** User-based alert notifications are highly dependent on alert policies. If you still need to configure an alert policy, we recommend reviewing our article on [Creating and Assigning Alert Policies](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044070572-Creating-and-Assigning-Alert-Policies).

## Personal Alert Notifications

The Rhombus console allows you to customize the type of alerts you receive and when they can be sent.

1\. To begin managing your alert notifications, log in to the Rhombus console, click your initials in the upper-right corner, and select "Alert Notifications."

![Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 10.41.42 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32355552498957)

2\. Next, click "Add another time frame."

![Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 10.48.56 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32355548020109)

3\. The following menu will allow you to set parameters for when your user account will be available to receive alerts.

![Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 10.51.09 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32355552504973)

4\. The first two columns, labeled "Hours" and "Days," work in tandem. Selecting "All Day" will send you alerts anytime during the selected days. If you would like to receive alerts during specific time windows, choose "Custom Time" and edit the times using the drop-down menus.

![Screen Recording 2024-12-02 at 11.04.00 AM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32355552508173)

5\. The next column, labeled "Get Alert Notifications For," allows you to customize precisely which devices you want to receive alerts from. By default, all devices and locations will be selected. De-selecting this option will enable you to specify which locations and which devices within those locations can alert you.

Checking the box next to the location name will select all the devices within that location. Opening the drop-down menu for a location will present a list of each device at that location, which can be selected individually.

Additionally, each device has specific alert types that you can be notified of. For example, you can be notified if a camera disconnects, if a sensor has a low battery, if an environmental sensor detects vape, etc. Each device has several alert types; customizing these ensures you only receive relevant alerts.

![Screen Recording 2024-12-02 at 12.54.50 PM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32360245393293)

6\. The column titled "Location Level Notifications" allows you to enable Lockdown or Third-Party Device notifications for the locations in your console.

7\. In the last column, titled "Send Notifications Via," you must select how you'd like to receive your notifications: by email, text message, browser notification, and/or as a push notification through the mobile app.

8\. "Adding Another Row" allows you to select another grouping of devices with a new notification type that will be on the same notification schedule.

Example: For Location A, you want to receive camera-only alerts, but for Location B, you want to add sensor alerts.

9\. "Add Another Time Frame" allows you to create another notification schedule altogether.

Example: For Location A, you have a Monday-Friday notification schedule, and for Location B, you have a Saturday-Sunday schedule.

10\. Once you've finished customizing when and how you'd like to receive alert notifications, click "Save" in the upper-right corner.

![Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 1.00.34 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32360389735821)

## Setting Up User Alert Notifications (for Super Admins)

As a Rhombus Administrator, you can customize when employees are available to receive notifications.

1\. Navigate to "Settings" and click "Manage Notifications."

![Screenshot 2024-12-03 at 12.19.51 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32397225323533)

2\. Once there, select the user whose notifications you'd like to manage or click "Add User" in the upper-right corner to create a new user and manage their notifications.

3\. You'll be presented with a screen similar to the "Alert Notifications" page in your user settings. Follow steps 3-10 outlined in " [Personal Alert Notifications](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001170072-User-Based-Alert-Notifications#h_01HA7YBXPAX5XFW4N1623B3MYV)" to adjust the notifications of the individual you selected.

## Notification Defaults

As a Rhombus Administrator, you can batch-assign default notifications to multiple users. Those users will not need to set up their notifications, as you can customize when and how they'll receive them. This is useful for admins who want to set up a default notification schedule for new users. Rhombus Administrators can also grant users access to modify their own alert notifications later.

1\. To set up default notifications, navigate to "Settings," "Manage Notifications," and make sure  "Notification Defaults" is highlighted in the upper-right corner.

![Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 3.12.03 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35883380287501)

2\. On the "Notification Defaults" page, you are presented with a notification template similar to the Alert Notification page in "User Settings." Follow steps 3-10 outlined in " [Personal Alert Notifications](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001170072-User-Based-Alert-Notifications#h_01HA7YBXPAX5XFW4N1623B3MYV)" to complete creating a default notification schedule.

**Note:** [DR40 User Manual](https://www.rhombus.com/files/manuals/DR40-Manual.pdf)

## About the DR40

The DR40 is Rhombus' five-in-one combination of a reader, camera, button, audio device, and relay. The relay can be used with a [Doorbell Rule](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/17560987145229-Installing-Registering-the-DR40#h_01HVVFFJBWPVG1FDZ31A2PYZWC). This powerful device allows you to enter secured locations via mobile app credentials (NFC), wave to unlock (BLE), or physical key cards.

The device contains a camera that allows you to view footage via the Rhombus Console. It can also be used as an intercom to communicate with guests or delivery drivers.

As a standalone device, the camera, intercom system, and button (doorbell) can be used without connecting to a DC20 for badge reader functionality.

![DR40 ISO 230222a (1).png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/17827055880461)

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26900962199053)

## Installation

- Communication: the DR40 communicates with an Access Controller (DC20) over RS-485 and uses the OSDP Protocol. It will be wired into the RS-485 ports on the DC20.
- Power (V+/V-): solid or stranded, minimum 18 AWG, 300 ft max run.
  - If PoE is used to power the DR40, V+/V- won't be used. To connect the DR40 to your network, you can run Cat5/6 directly to a PoE switch or through a PoE injector and connect it via Wi-Fi.
  - Power to the reader can be supplied using PoE or a 12-28VDC external power source. DR40 has a maximum current rating of 791 mA at 12VDC and **cannot be powered directly by the DC20.**

![DR40 WIRE LABEL_230727.svg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/17990170424973)

Figure 1.) Example wiring diagram for the DR40 showing all available wires.

### Wiring Requirements and Diagrams

- Data (A/B/GND): solid or stranded, twisted pair, minimum 24 AWG, 300 ft max run.
- Other: (COM/NO): solid or stranded, minimum 24 AWG, 300 ft max run.
- **Note:** Existing cables can potentially be re-used if they meet the minimum required AWG. Wiring methods used shall be in accordance with the National Electric Code, ANSI/NFPA 70.

For more details, please reference the [full DR40 manual](https://www.rhombus.com/files/manuals/DR40-Manual.pdf).

- Connect the \[A\], \[B\] and \[GND\] lines of the DR40 to the corresponding terminals in the DC20.
- **Note:** We recommend you consult the appropriate federal, state, and local authorities for any relevant regulations at the time of installation.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26900931580685)

Figure 3.) Power to the DR40 can be supplied through PoE. Even if PoE is not used, an Ethernet connection is still required.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26900931589005)

Figure 4.) Power can also be supplied using a 12-28VDC external power source. An ethernet connection is required.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/26901134075917)

Figure 5.) The DR40 also comes equipped with one dry contact normally open relay. This can be used for externally powered devices rated up to 30VDC/DC, 1A max.

## Registration

The DR40 can be used combined with the DC20 or as a standalone product. Depending on its use case, two different registration methods are available.

### With the DC20

The DR40 will auto-register to your Rhombus console once it's connected to a DC20, assuming that the DC20 has a stable network connection.

To ensure this will happen, navigate to the "Settings" tab, select "Door Controllers," and click the controller you wish to verify. Ensure "Auto-register Readers" is toggled on in the RS-485 Ports section (this is toggled on by default).

![Screenshot 2025-01-14 at 2.16.03 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/33483505776013)

### For Standalone Use

Once the DR40 has been installed, you can register it through the Rhombus mobile app via [Bluetooth](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/17560987145229-Installing-Registering-the-DR40#h_01HSEVWQK1VFCFG19NKT5PWSR9) or via [QR Code](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/17560987145229-Installing-Registering-the-DR40#h_01HEP3G1KJD4AD8MAA8G5EGCDG).

## Setting Up Doorbell Notifications

It's important to note that our doorbell sound is intentionally designed to be attention-grabbing without being disruptive. It serves to alert nearby individuals promptly, even if they're not actively monitoring the device.

**Note:** The doorbell volume is set to the maximum allowable level by default and further adjustments aren't possible.

To increase doorbell volume:

- Connect the device that is monitoring for notifications (an iPad etc.) to an external speaker to boost the sound of the notification.

**Note:** When using an iPad or other device, the sound associated with a doorbell notification will only play if you are actively watching the specific door whose bell is rung.
- You can connect the DR40 Door Reader to a doorbell chime to boost the volume on the doorbell press. For more information, please see the article on [Connecting a DR40 to a Wired Doorbell.](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/26100636680333-DR40-Connected-to-a-Wired-Doorbell)

The DR40 has a button that can be used as a doorbell. Doorbell events can be set up in two ways:

- A [Doorbell Rule](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/17560987145229-Installing-Registering-the-DR40#h_01HVVFFJBWPVG1FDZ31A2PYZWC) can be created on the DR40 devices page and then configured in [User Notifications](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001170072-User-Based-Alert-Notifications).
- A policy with "Doorbell Press" as part of the policy can be assigned and then configured in [User Notifications](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001170072-User-Based-Alert-Notifications).

  - For more information on creating policies, please visit the [Creating and Assigning Alert Policies](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044070572-Creating-and-Assigning-Alert-Policies) article.

### Creating a Doorbell Rule

A Doorbell Rule can provide several different actions on button press:

- Generate Notification​
  - Generates an instant notification that will not be associated with any clips to reduce the time taken. Notifications for these can be configured under the "Manage Notifications" section in Settings by selecting the Video Intercom/Badge Reader dropdown and clicking "Doorbell Pressed."
- Play Audio File​
  - Play a previously saved clip, upload text-to-speech, create a new recording, or upload a recording. This can be used to play through a connected A100 or the DR40.
- Trigger Relay
  - The DR40 can be directly connected to a simple relay on the device. Its hardware includes a button configured as a doorbell and a generic relay.

  - The DR40 is equipped with one dry contact Normally Open (NO) relay that can be used to control externally powered devices such as door chimes or lights rated up to 30 VAC/DC, 1A max. ​

### Included Parts List

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/17989494209933)

## Mounting the DC20

The DC20 is intended to be wall-mounted indoors in a secured area, such as a locked server room or utility closet.

To install, pre-drill pilot holes into the desired mounting surface in accordance with the mounting specifications provided.

**Note:** A 3/16” pilot hole is required if you're using wall anchors.

An alternative pre-drilling option utilizes the extra mounting screw included to hang the DC20 through the center keyhole slot located in the back of the device. Once leveled, the four hole positions can be marked on the mounting surface and pre-drilled.

After the holes have been pre-drilled, fasten the device to the surface using the included mounting screws. The DC20 can be mounted on surfaces such as metal or concrete, but appropriate #8 screws must be used.

## Wiring for the DC20

Wiring methods shall be in accordance with the National Electrical Code, ANSI/NFPA 70.

All wiring of the DC20 should be performed prior to connecting the power. Power should be removed before attempting to service the DC20 or any of its connected devices.

**WARNING:** Failure to remove power prior to servicing the DC20 may damage connected devices. We recommend you consult the appropriate federal, state, and local authorities for any relevant regulations at the time of installation.

## How to Install a Backup Universal Power Supply (UPS) to the DC20

The DC20 has provisions for a backup battery to support offline mode in case primary power is lost. The battery must be 12V Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) type, with F1 or F2 style connectors. The maximum space reserved for a standby battery(s) is 300mm L x 80mm W x 110mm H. Two new and unused batteries of the same make and model may be wired together in parallel to increase standby capacity.

The battery capacity should be sized appropriately based on the power consumption of the overall system and the desired run time during an outage. Many factors include, but are not limited to, the type of powered devices used (locks, readers, and other power accessories), unlock frequency, battery age, and even ambient temperature can affect the total backup duration.

## Best Practices Before Aiming a Camera

1\. Ensure that the camera is wired appropriately. For more information on wiring, please review the article on [Wiring New Rhombus Cameras](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049435051-Wiring-New-Rhombus-Cameras).

2\. Remove the dome with the three Torx T10 screws.

**Note:** R400 model uses T20 security Torx & R170/R500/R510 models use Phillips screws.

3\. Connect and mount the camera. Do not reattach the dome yet. For more information, please review our article on [Mounting a New Rhombus Camera](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051360951-Mounting-a-New-Rhombus-Camera).

4\. Register the camera and view its live feed.

**Note:** R2-L live feed will look blurry while the dome is off.

## General Aiming Notes

![Aim-Words-NotBlocked.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360040277592)

- On all cameras besides the R360, aiming is performed manually with the dome removed. The lens cannot be adjusted remotely through the console (the lens is not motorized.) It's best to aim during installation before reattaching the dome.
- The image module rotates on three axes to aim the lens: pan, tilt, and roll. If it doesn't seem to move in the direction you want, try rotating all the way around to the other side.
- Once aimed, rotate the module's "roll" axis to ensure the image sensor is level. The light sensor needs to be located on the top or bottom, and the IR LEDs to the left and right, as shown above.
- Ensure the white housing cover does not block the light sensor when the dome is reattached to the camera.
- Confirm that the aim is as desired by viewing a live feed from the camera.
- Cameras also feature 1.25X digital pan/tilt/zoom for fine adjustment, which can be remotely controlled in the console.

### Aiming an R100/R120

Aiming the R100 and R120 are relatively the same. The video below demonstrates how to move the lens to the desired orientation.

![mceclip0.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4411186910221)

### Aiming an R2/R200/R2-180

The R2/R200 camera lens can be aimed manually when the dome is removed. For this reason, it's most efficient to aim the view during installation.

**Special Notes for R2-L and R2-180**

- **R2-L** performs best when the lens is aimed through the center (not the edge) of the clear dome. The image will appear blurry when the dome is off during aiming and become sharp when the dome is replaced. R2-L's focus is optimized at a 90ft distance; objects nearer than about 40ft will be out of focus.
- **R2-180** can be mounted on a wall or ceiling. When mounted on a wall, the camera can see along the wall in both directions. When mounted on a ceiling, the camera can provide a view of half the area around it; two co-located R2-180s can provide full coverage of the area. R2-180 has multiple de-warping options with different fields of view, which should be considered when the lens is aimed.

![Gif3.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/360037848632)

### Aiming an R360

Do not attempt to adjust the physical lens of the R360; the camera lens does not move.

### Aiming an R400

Similarly to the cameras above, the R400 has a rotatable base and lens, with an added tile to the lens.

![mceclip0.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4411180967181)

### Aiming an R500

The R500 has a ball joint that allows you to rotate and angle it in any desired orientation.

![mceclip1.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4411188445197)

Here is a top-view image of the ball joint for the R500:

### Aiming an R600

|     |
| --- |
| All four lenses can be independently angled and rotated with the dome removed. |

## Permissions-Based Roles

It's common for admins to manage the content users can access. Chances are, there are cameras, sensors, or access control devices within your organization that only specific people should be able to access. With permissions-based roles, you can control the level of visibility and access to devices within the console.

## How to Create a Role

1\. To set up a new role, log into the Rhombus Console, navigate to "Settings," and click "Manage Roles."

![Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 10.32.14 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35873699692813)

2\. Next, select "Add Role" in the upper right-hand corner, and a window will appear to create the role.

![Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 10.51.33 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35874222075533)

3\. Enter the name for this role and click "Next" in the bottom right corner.

![Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 10.53.58 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35874222078093)

**Note:** Every organization has a "Super Admin" role by default, which cannot be removed. Users assigned this role are allowed to access everything within the account.

## Permissions and the Access They Grant

Enabling permissions will grant roles with specific access and administrative actions within the Rhombus console. Below is a breakdown of each permission and what that permission allows a user to access.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Permission | Type of Access Granted |

## Cloning a Role

Cloning a role allows you to create a secondary role that starts with the same base access but can be altered if you want to change the access slightly. Begin by navigating to "Settings" and clicking "Manage Roles." Once there, find the role you wish to clone and select "Clone" on the right side. You must review the permissions and device access before saving the role.

## Two-Factor Authentication Update
[Skip to main content](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/9027336324493-Two-Factor-Authentication-Update#main-content)

In this article, we will go over the new Rhombus updates for 2-factor authentication:

- [2FA](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/9027336324493-Two-Factor-Authentication-Update#h_01GCF9VPSNY5NEKS1WY19M7QQN)
- [Summary](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/9027336324493-Two-Factor-Authentication-Update#h_01GCHRHC5XPCBYSCNVNTAGFD90)

## **Two-Factor Authentication Update (2FA)**

Whenever new users log in from a browser or mobile app, they will be prompted to go through a captcha and 2-Factor Authentication.

![IMG_1474.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/9312071898509)

Once users have gone through this first login process, they will no longer need to go through a captcha, but they will be prompted to go through 2FA.

![IMG_1475.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/9312100342541)

This 2FA requirement is required for all organizations but admins can allow users to opt out of 2FA for a period of time on trusted devices. An account-wide setting will be made available to specify after how many days (ranging from one to 365) users will need to re-authenticate.

![Screen_Shot_2022-12-05_at_3.41.50_PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/11200277807757)

When logging into their account, users will have three opportunities to enter the correct password before going through the captcha and 2FA process, even if they are in their opt-out period. If a userrepeatedly fails to enter a valid password, that device will become untrusted. If 10 combined failed login attempts occur from any untrusted source, that account will be locked for 10 minutes for any untrusted source. Trusted devices will still be able to log in.

## **Summary**

1. Users on untrusted devices must solve a Recaptcha when entering a password ("I'm not a robot"; a device becomes trusted after successful login).
2. By default, 2FA will be enabled for all organizations. However, when entering a 2FA code, the user can "skip 2FA for future logins" on a per-device basis for a period of days as set by their org.
3. A lockout mechanism was added when too many incorrect passwords are entered (10 for untrusted devices; a warning is given when 1-3 tries remain).

| ![Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 2.53.04 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32501813323149) |

## Vehicle Counting

With Vehicle Counting enabled, you can get a graph trend for the **Estimated Total Vehicles** and compare it against other cameras. You can also deselect any cameras at the bottom in order to look at one camera at a time.

![Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 2.56.10 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32501970860941)

- You can adjust the desired time frame for viewing by using the hourly dropdown and calendar dropdown menus.

![Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 2.58.51 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32501970866957)

- You can download the data points into a .csv file by clicking the download icon next to the time frame selection dropdown menus.

![Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 3.00.48 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32501970871181)

- The "Vehicle Count" column will be blank if there are no instances at the time. You will get the following information:

![Screenshot 2023-09-13 at 8.52.47 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/19458304356109)

## People Counting

People Counting is a report feature that can capture the number of people in a location at a given time period. To enable the "People Counting" feature, an enterprise license must be assigned to the device. Once assigned, you will need to ensure "People Counting" is toggled on.

"Facial Recognition" must also be toggled on to use the "Unique Visitors" metric.

![Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 3.07.55 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32503008116621)

### Estimated Unique Visitors

Unique Visitor Counting relies on [facial recognition](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000327872-Managing-Facial-Recognition) being enabled to count the number of unique visitors a location might have in a given period of time.

Unique Visitor Counting can be configured to display based on different lengths of time, such as 15 minutes, hours, days, or months. Hover over individual points in time to see the associated stats.

**Note:** The accuracy of this feature is dependent on the accuracy of facial recognition. Please ensure that you review the following documentation for best results:

- [Facial Recognition Management](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000327872-Managing-Facial-Recognition)
- [Camera Positioning](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033449431-Aiming-a-Rhombus-Camera)

![Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 3.50.16 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32503008118157)

### Estimated Total Visitors

Estimated Total Visitors gives a count estimate for the number of people seen, regardless of facial recognition detection. This metric is useful in situations where there is a lot of foot traffic and identifying faces is difficult due to camera positioning (e.g., in front of a retail store, kiosk, or trade show).

Hover over individual points in time to see the associated stats.

**Note:** This counting method uses human movement, not unique face capture, so the same person will be counted as multiple instances if they continue to walk back and forth in front of the camera.

### ![Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 3.52.10 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32503008119821)

### Motion Events

When a camera captures any sort of motion, it will be logged as a Motion Event. These types of events are useful in situations where you want to track motion in areas where you do/don't expect it (e.g., Human Movement, Unidentified Face).

Hover over individual points in time to see the associated stats.

### ![Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 3.54.36 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32503029609101)

## Alert Trends

- The Alert Trends graph shows you the number of instances in which various alert types are generated.

![Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 3.56.52 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32503192967565)

- You can set a specified timeframe to view these alerts by using the dropdown menus in the top right corner.

![Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 3.57.40 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32503207037197)

- You can also download the data as a .csv file by clicking the download button next to the timeframe menus.

## Overview

InformaCast is a powerful software platform designed for mass notification and emergency communication within organizations. It enables users to send messages instantly to a variety of communication devices including IP phones, mobile devices, computers, digital signage, and paging systems.

## Configuring Your InformaCast Integration

To configure your integration in the Rhombus console, you'll need to gather the API token provided by InformaCast and a scenario to leverage the Rhombus integrations. We will go over both below.

## Generating an Informacast Security Token

1. Navigate to the "Security Groups" tab under the "Admin" tab and select the "Create Security Group" button.![A1.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24677325142669)
2. Then, enter the name of the security group and select the "Save" button.![A2.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24677507448845)
3. Once created, you will need to configure the global permissions to include "View Sites," "View Scenarios," and "Create Scenario Notifications." ``![A3.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24677507465613)
4. Navigate to the "Applications" tab under the "Admin" tab and create a new application. ``
5. Then, assign the security group you made in steps 1-3 to this application.![A6.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24678278336525)![A7.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24678278357389)
6. Lastly, select the create a "Security Token" button to generate the necessary API key.![A8.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24678278373261)![A9.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24678278388621)![A10.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24678278402829) ``

## Creating a Scenario

1. Navigate to the "Message Templates" tab and create a message template.![A1 (1).png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24679515158669)![A2 (1).png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24679489360013)
2. Navigate to the "Scenarios" tab and create a scenario.![A3 (1).png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24680231332749)![A4 (1).png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24680255655181)
3. The scenario must have the following variables:

```
locationName
deviceName
activity

## Steps to Verify Chain of Custody

To verify the chain of custody of a saved video, follow the steps below. These steps allow you to validate that a video is a legitimate Rhombus clip.

1\. Navigate to the "Saved Video" tab on the left side of the console.

2\. Find the saved clip and download it.

![Screenshot 2025-05-20 at 2.47.14 PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36773128791437)

3\. Click on the thumbnail (first picture below) of the clip to open the clip information pane (second picture below) and copy the command next to "Validate."

![Screen_Shot_2021-06-08_at_3.28.47_PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4402655120525)![Screen_Shot_2021-06-08_at_3.29.32_PM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4402655126541)

4\. Open Terminal on your computer (if on PC open Powershell) and navigate to your Downloads folder or wherever you downloaded the clip to.

```
% cd ./path/to/file
```

5\. Run the validate command, as collected in step 3, with the clip file name attached to get the [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) for that clip (For PC: Hash = Checksum).

**Note:** When entering the commands below, ensure you use the appropriate clip name. In our example we use "Eric Test."

Command

```
% shasum -a 256 Eric\ Test.mp4 (Mac)

> Get-FileHash './Eric Test.mp4' (PC)
```

Output

```
Mac
% 844a68d28664b77ddbda092d03d0949f5d6273c29cb2cbf98921f748c4fee712  Eric Test.mp4

PC
> Algorithm       Hash                                                                   Path
  ---------       ----                                                                   ----
  SHA256          844A68D28664B77DDBDA092D03D0949F5D6273C29CB2CBF98921F748C4FEE712       /Users/Downloads/Eric Test.mp4
```

6\. Copy the checksum from the output and replace the below "String1" with it. Then, in the clip information pane copy the checksum next to "Checksum" and replace the below "String2" with it.

Mac Command

```
% [[ "string1" == "string2" ]] && echo "True" || echo "False"
```

Windows Command

```
% "String1" -eq "String2"
```

7\. Verify the output of Step 6. If "True" is output then the checksums are the same. If "False" is the output then the checksums are not the same.

Validate command:

```
% shasum -a 256 ./path/to/file (Mac)

> Get-FileHash ./path/to/file (PC)
```

## Prerequisites

Before you can register a Rhombus camera, you will need:

- Rhombus Console Account
- Mobile phone with downloaded Rhombus App ( [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombussystems.rhombus) or [iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rhombus/id1237841963)
- Camera connected to network and power
- Provided Waterproofing Kit (reference [this](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020141532-Preventing-Water-Damage) article for details on installation)

## Waterproofing

Following the waterproofing guidelines is essential to ensure your product is covered under our End User License Agreement and Hardware Warranty. Failure to complete the waterproofing steps outlined in the product manual may void your warranty and limit our liability for related damages. For more information, please refer to our [EULA.](https://legal.rhombus.com/end-user-tos/eula)

Use the included accessories to waterproof the cable connection, installing them as shown below. Ensure the O-ring is in place (and not twisted) between the pigtail and the housing, and lock the housing and pigtail together with a quarter-turn. Using an Ethernet cable without a boot or strain relief is best for fitting easily within the housing. After mounting the camera, ensure that all three dome screws are firmly tightened to prevent water ingress.

![R200_wp (edit2).png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30706861608973)

It is crucial to tighten the housing tightly, but not too tight, so the internal O-ring seals properly. The following picture demonstrates that when the R120/R200 is mounted on its side, the O-ring and the silica packets inside are the only things stopping the water from getting in.

![mceclip11.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/30234078985997)

For more information on waterproofing, please visit our article on [Preventing Water Damage](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020141532-Preventing-Water-Damage).

## Connecting the Camera

To complete registration, a camera needs power and should be connected to a local network that has access to the internet. Rhombus recommends using a PoE (Power over Ethernet) switch or PoE injector to accomplish this. For more information please consult the following [Network Setup Guide](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/6319246804237-Networking-Best-Practices).

- Ensure the switch has power.
- Configure the network to comply with Rhombus requirements. Please reference our [Network Setup Guide](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/6319246804237-Networking-Best-Practices) for more details on network configuration.
- Connect the camera to the PoE switch for power and ethernet. It should automatically boot up and you can begin the registration process.

## Mounting on a Wall or Ceiling

Below are the steps for mounting the camera on a wall or ceiling:

- Open the dome by unscrewing three housing screws with included Torx tool.
- Use included mounting template to drill holes for screws and cable.
- Use three included M4x25mm round head self-tapping screws to mount the base to the surface.
- Use three included anchors when mounting to softer materials.
- Replace the dome and tighten three housing screws with included Torx tool.

## Accessory Guide

For the R120/R200, we offer accessories for mounting the camera on a corner, on a pole, or protruding from the wall with an extension rod. [Here](https://www.rhombus.com/accessories/) is a link to a list of our accessories for the R120/R200.

## Registration Methods

Once you have powered up your camera and connected to the internet, you can register it. Ensure the camera has the correct LED status that indicates it's ready to be registered.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Camera Model** | **Connected to Rhombus Servers** | **Not Connected to Rhombus Servers** | **Registration Failure** |
| R120/R200 | Blinking Green | 2 Green \[Pause\] 2 Green \[Repeat\] **OR** 1 Red \[Pause\] 1 Green \[Repeat\] | Slow blinking Red IR LEDs |

A full explanation of all LED statuses can be found [here](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/14793298069773-Device-LED-Statuses).

![Screenshot_20241121-164606.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/32085124800525)

3\. Select the preferred registration method: QR Code or Bluetooth.

**Note:** More than one R120/R200 can be registered at the same time via Bluetooth. We recommend registering at least one Bluetooth-enabled camera before registering a sensor device.

![IMG_4876.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35598221111309)

4\. Assign the R120/R200 to a location. Choose "Add Location" if you need to add a new location for the device.

**Note:** If you don't see the location you are looking for, filter the results by clicking the 'filter' button at the top right.

![IMG_4877.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35598223443725)

5\. Select the camera connection type: Ethernet

![IMG_4878.PNG](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35598275923085)

6\. The last screen will display a QR code that you can hold up to the camera lens to finish registration. When you hear an audible click and the red IR LED's flash, you'll know the camera has accepted the QR code.

**Note:** This step is not needed if registered via BLE.

**Bluetooth Registration**

If you opt to register via Bluetooth, you will arrive at this screen. Toggle the slider for the corresponding camera serial number.

![](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/25937442946189)

7\. Once registration is complete, the camera will have a solid blue LED. This can take a few minutes.

### Web Console

1\. To register a camera from the web console, go to the "Devices" tab and select "Register Cameras."

If this is the first camera you are registering, you'll need to add a location first, either during this wizard or by selecting the Locations tab and choosing "Add Location."

![Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 10.21.39 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/35526466350989)

2\. When the registration window pops up, the first prompt asks you to enter your mobile number to receive a link to download the mobile app. If you would prefer to register via the web console, you can ignore this first step and click "Next" at the bottom right.

3\. Select the location where these cameras will be registered and click "Next."

4\. Select Ethernet and click "Next."

5\. Select which roles will have access to these devices. You can choose between no access, view-only access, or full management permissions.

6\. Select a policy to assign to these cameras and click "Next." (If you would prefer to have different policies applied to multiple cameras, leave the policy selection blank.)

7\. The final screen will display the QR Registration Code. Show this QR Code to any camera that is powered and connected to the internet, and it will register accordingly.

**Note:** If you do not hear a click, try moving the phone toward and away from the camera.

## Physical Tamper

Physical tamper alerts are caused when the device's structure moves, spins, or is suddenly impacted by other objects and people. This alert provides a user with proactive notifications for a device that has been physically tampered with. Currently, Physical Tamper is available for our A100, R120, R170, R200, R230, and R600 devices.

![Screen_Recording_2023-03-17_at_2.45.32_PM.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/14099437292045)

## Visual Tamper

This feature is handy for detecting when the camera's field of view has been tampered with, like when someone covers the dome with spray paint. This feature works by using the full view of the camera window as a reference, and when it becomes "covered," the system will flag and mark the detection time. All of our Rhombus cameras have the ability to detect visual tamper once enabled.

![mceclip4.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/18561851992845)

## Setting Tamper Alerts and Notifications

To receive tamper alert notifications, you must ensure that an alert policy is created and assigned to the specific camera or audio gateway and that your notification settings are enabled for these alert types.

### Alert Policies

To set up an alert policy, log in to the Rhombus Console > Settings > Alert Policies. ![Screenshot 2024-07-24 at 8.25.53 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/28677928568973)

From there, you can either create a new policy or edit a previous one. You must select the intended tamper events for which you want to be alerted and then assign a schedule, as shown below.

![Screenshot 2024-07-24 at 8.21.37 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/28677914043021)

### Alert Notifications

To set up alert notifications for a specific user, log in to the Rhombus Console > Settings > Manage Notifications > Specific User. ![Screenshot 2024-07-24 at 8.27.36 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/28677914046093)

From there, you must set a time frame, the location(s)/device(s) for which you want to be notified, and a notification delivery avenue. Once that is completed, you can select the alert types for which you want to be notified, as shown below.

## Share Livestream via Console

Sharing a Livestream allows a camera feed to be shared on a website or directly with another party without granting access to the Rhombus Console. This Shared Stream is created on the timeline of the device's page.

There are two methods you can use to create this link:

## Overview

Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) is the flow of electric current between two electrically charged objects. This can occur when a positively charged object makes contact with a negatively charged object. Friction can also cause static electricity to build up in an object and transfer it to another object. Lastly, a charge can be created by induction, which means that charged objects can charge other conductors nearby without any physical contact.

ESD-sensitive devices are electrical devices and electronic components that are vulnerable and can be damaged from ESD such as Integrated Circuits and Printed Circuit Boards.

## Best Practices for Handling ESD-Sensitive Devices

It is crucial to be aware of ESD damage and ways to prevent it. However, it is good to be mindful of this topic in general, as it can be applied to other products as well. Keeping in mind that people are the most common source of ESD, here are a few simple ways to prevent ESD from happening.

### Take Precautionary Measures

- Installers should try avoiding as much friction as possible. For example, clothing such as sweaters and corduroy materials tend to create more static through friction, instead wear cotton. As a general note, boards or components should never come in contact with clothing because normal grounding cannot dissipate static charges on fabrics. Be mindful of other everyday examples that could create friction such as walking across a carpet or peeling tape.
- During installation, if there is a junction box used for mounting, it would be a good practice to touch the junction box before touching the camera or to touch any other metal surface (a ladder for example).
- Humidity levels also affect the amount of charge created, a lower relative humidity level increases charge generation as the environment is drier. Dry skin, especially in the winter, is a leading cause of ESD.

### Wear ESD-Safe Equipment

It is highly encouraged that ESD-sensitive devices are handled only after personnel have grounded themselves via wrist straps and mats.

#### Wrist Straps

The wrist strap is an effective piece of safety gear that aids and prevents the buildup of static electricity near highly sensitive electronics. You can think of the wrist strap as a ground bracelet. It consists of two elements, a wristband and a ground cord. The wrist strap has a 1-mega Ohm resistor built into it that has to be in contact with a surface, in this case, skin.

![IMG_7955.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/16555384555149)

![IMG_7945.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/16555408018189)

#### ESD Work Mats

ESD mats include a metal conductor that charges from surface contact. Mats would be a great addition to using wrist straps because they will transfer the static charge from the user to the mat and the ground. The mat is essentially acting as a large resistor.

![IMG_7938.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/16555384556429)

There are other options available such as ESD gloves, smocks, lab coats, and jackets.

## Handling Circuit Boards

### Directly

There are some scenarios where the installer could come in direct contact with a circuit board, for example, when replacing an SD card, or aiming the camera lens. That is when sensitive devices would be at the highest vulnerability. To avoid ESD damage in those situations, connect to a grounded wrist strap, place the device with the circuit board on a static-controlled surface (ground yourself first on a grounded floor or table mat), and try not to directly touch the board if it can be avoided.

![IMG_7949.gif](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/16555408018701)

### Indirectly

There are other instances where the installer could indirectly expose the circuit board to ESD damage, for example when removing the lid of a camera. ESD could be conducted through a screwdriver, therefore, make sure to ground the screwdriver first before working on any cameras. Another scenario would be when plugging in the camera to PoE through an Ethernet cable, if the installer has a charge, that charge will be transferred. To avoid this, ground all conductors, including yourself, before handling and plugging in the cameras.

## Workstation Rules

As a recap, try following these simple rules to ensure an ESD-protected work area:

1. **Don't take off your wrist strap,** unplug it to move around but don't take it off or you will need to retest.
2. **Keep out all insulators**(materials that don't allow current flow and cannot be discharged by grounding), packing materials such as plastic bags and Styrofoam, paper, or tissues.
3. **Keep all sensitive hardware directly on the work mats**
4. **No rolling chairs**
5. **No food or drinks**
6. **Move slowly and precisely**

# Ethernet

## Power over Ethernet (PoE) Switch

To connect a Rhombus camera over PoE, simply connect the camera to an 802.3af compliant (passive or 24V PoE is not compatible) PoE switch on your network. The ethernet cable will provide both power and an internet connection.

For the best experience, we recommend using a cloud-managed switch. This will give real-time data about the cameras as well as the ability to remotely power cycle them.

![blobid2.jpg](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4420448698509)

## Power over Ethernet (PoE) Injector

If you are using a router or switch without PoE, power can be added to the cable with a PoE injector. The injector should be 802.3af compliant (passive or 24V PoE is not compatible).

![blobid0.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/4420448656653)

## Wi-Fi with the R230

The R230 camera has an integrated Wi-Fi antenna, allowing you to connect it to your wireless network during registration. For information on this process, please see the [following article](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/12926027619853-R230-Camera-Setup#h_01G50559DDFMN96CRPHMSVCED3).

The camera's power and/or network can be provided with either a PoE switch or injector.

![R230 Diagram.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/25152249410829)

## Wi-Fi Adapter Usage

For this configuration, simply plug an ethernet cord into the back of the R1 or R2 camera and the other end into the RP131 adapter. Register the camera to connect via WiFi and provide the network credentials for a 2.4GHz network in the app. The RP131 adapter acts as the camera's WiFi antenna and power source.

## Rhombus App Descriptions

Rhombus now has two apps that can be used and downloaded. Please ensure you are downloading the correct app for the intended use.

![Screenshot 2024-03-07 at 9.37.21 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/24787504430093)

The Rhombus Key app (for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/rhombus-key/id1669560104) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhombus.android.key&hl=en_US&gl=US)) is the app associated with Rhombus Access Control. This app gives users access to "Wave to Unlock," "Remote Unlock," and other Access Control features.

## Unlock Methods

### Wave to Unlock

Wave to Unlock is a touchless form of access control that allows users to wave their hand in front of the Rhombus Credential Readers (DR20 and DR40) to authenticate their assigned mobile credentials. This eliminates the need for a physical credential, such as a proximity card or key fob.

It utilizes a combination of a motion sensor on the reader and the Bluetooth signal on the phone to obtain and process the mobile credential within a designated range of the reader. Someone with administrative access can customize this range within the Rhombus Console.

Please reference the [Wave to Unlock](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/20726184867725-Wave-to-Unlock) article to learn more about this feature.

### Remote Unlock

Remote Unlock, if enabled for a user, allows the user to remotely unlock a door through the app by selecting the door from the [Doors Page](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/24787313588749-Rhombus-Key-App-Walkthrough#h_01HRD47VD66XTASDCQP3AK5BKM) to initiate the unlock.

#### Geofenced Remote Unlock

Geofenced Remote Unlock allows organizations to restrict Remote Unlock based on distance from the door. This is a door-specific setting, and will apply to any user who has access to that door.

1\. Navigate to the door through the "Devices" tab. Scroll down to the "Details" section and click "Refine Placement."

![Screenshot 2025-04-30 at 9.03.09 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36247380862733)

2\. Place the door on the map and click "Save."

3\. Click "Settings" on the door page, and "Remote unlock."

![Screenshot 2025-04-30 at 9.21.25 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36247428673293)

4\. Toggle on "Geofence Enabled" and select a radius in feet that a user will be able to use Remote Unlock. Click "Save."

![Screenshot 2025-04-30 at 9.23.58 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36247428674189)

### Tap to Unlock (NFC Android Only)

Tap to Unlock uses an NFC credential on the Android app that allows a user to hold the phone up to the reader to badge in.

Ensure the phone is held still up to the reader. If the phone is "waved", you may inadvertently activate the "Wave to Unlock" feature, which tells the reader to look for a Bluetooth signal instead of the NFC credential.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure you are running the most recent version of the app.
- Uninstall and reinstall the app.
- Ensure the appropriate permissions are granted.
- Ensure that the application is open and running when using wave-to-unlock.
- Ensure that the magic key link is launched from the related mobile device when logging in.

## Overview

A "bounding box" is a rectangular area used as a reference point for object detection. The bounding box outlines the parameters for the detection of Events by the system, providing a visual representation of the area in which the Rhombus cameras capture and interpret the surrounding environment. Events are only triggered by activity within the bounding box.

## Bounding Box Criteria

Bounding boxes are never shown on real-time video streams, only historical footage.

![Screenshot 2025-04-24 at 10.21.02 AM.png](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/article_attachments/36097088297997)

When bounding boxes will appear:

1. If you have an [Enterprise License](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404466850957-Console-Features-Licensing#h_01F9Z1M5N5QQFAH4VJJ2W9Z0R4) applied to the camera and have AI features enabled.
2. If you have [Alert Notifications](https://support.rhombussystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001170072-User-Based-Alert-Notifications), they will show up only for the hours you have configured to receive alerts.

**Note:**

- Bounding boxes can take up to 5 minutes to show up on historical video.
- Bounding boxes are never shown on mobile devices, only on web browsers.
- Bounding boxes are not included in shared streams.

## Enable/Disable Bounding Boxes

## Overview

The digital zoom and pan features allow you to manually adjust the focus and positioning of individual cameras for a closer or more customized view. You can zoom in or pan the camera at any time, and these adjustments will remain in place until you change them again.

Additionally, while viewing footage, you can temporarily zoom in and out for a better look at specific details without affecting the permanent camera settings.

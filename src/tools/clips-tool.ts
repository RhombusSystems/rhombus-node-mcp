const TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `
Retrieves saved video clips from the Rhombus system. Saved clips can be viewed for up to 2 years and are typically found in the "Clips" tab of the "Saved Video" section of the Rhombus Console.

This tool allows you to filter clips by:
* Whether or not they are expiring soon.
* Specific devices using their UUIDs.
* Specific locations using their UUIDs.
* A simple string search on clip names.
* A time range, specifying a start (timestampISOAfter) and/or end (timestampISOBefore) timestamp in ISO 8601 format.

The tool returns a JSON object with the following structure and important fields:
* **errorMsg (string | null):** An error message if the request failed.
* **objecterror (boolean | null):** Indicates if an object-level error occurred.
* **pageToken (string | null):** A token to be supplied on the next search request to get the next page of results. If this token is null, there is no more data available.
* **savedClips (array of objects | null):** An array where each object represents a saved video clip. Each clip object contains the following important fields:
    * **uuid (string):** The unique identifier for the video clip.
    * **title (string):** The name given to the video clip.
    * **description (string | null):** An optional description for the clip.
    * **timestampMs (int64):** The start time of the video clip in milliseconds since epoch.
    * **createdAtMs (int64):** The creation timestamp of the clip in milliseconds since epoch.
    * **createdAtTimestamp (string):** The creation timestamp of the clip in ISO 8601 format.
    * **deviceUuid (string):** The UUID of the primary device (e.g., camera) that recorded the clip.
    * **deviceUuids (array of strings or null):** A list of UUIDs for all devices associated with the clip.
    * **durationSec (int32):** The length of the video clip in seconds.
    * **status (string):** The current processing status of the clip, with possible values such as INITIATING, UPLOADING, RENDERING, FAILED, COMPLETE, OFFLINE, or UNKNOWN.
    * **userUuid (string | null):** The UUID of the user associated with the clip, if applicable.
    * **sourceAlertUuid (string | null):** The UUID of the alert that triggered the creation of this clip, if any.

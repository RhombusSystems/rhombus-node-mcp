const TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `
This tool can perform some action pertaining to the video stream of a camera. There are two types of requests
that can be passed into "requestType":
- image
- get-settings

What follows is a description of the behavior of this tool given the requestType "image"

This tool should be used any time someone wants to specify a subset of cameras to use for a task, based on some features that the camera sees.  For example, interior cameras, cameras facing the street, cameras with a view of X, Y, Z, etc.

For instance if someone says "I want X using cameras with Y" then this tool should get a snapshot of the image to answer the question of if the camera satisfies the Y predicate.

This tool captures and returns a real-time snapshot from a designated security camera.
The image reflects the current scene in the camera's field of view and serves as a contextual
input source for downstream tasks such as object recognition, anomaly detection, incident investigation,
or situational assessment. When invoked, the tool provides the following: 
â€¢  Visual Scene Capture: A high-resolution image of what the camera is actively observing, including people, vehicles, license plates, and any detectable objects.  

What follows is a description of the behavior of this tool given the requestType "get-settings"

This tool retrieves the current configuration for a specified camera or associated device (e.g., sensor, access controller). The returned JSON object can include detailed camera settings (e.g., resolution, bitrate) and various device-specific configurations (e.g. storage settings).

NOTE: To update camera settings, use the update-tool instead.

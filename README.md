2. Generate your magic key at [API Key Settings](https://console.rhombus.com/settings/api-management) ✨
3. Activate your powers by setting `RHOMBUS_API_KEY` in your environment 💪

### Step 2: Supercharge Claude Desktop

1. Grab the incredible Claude desktop [right here](https://claude.ai/download)! 📥

2. Unleash the magic by adding this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

### DOCKER

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rhombus": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "RHOMBUS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
        "rhombussystems/mcp-server-rhombus"
      ],
      "env": {
        "RHOMBUS_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### NPX

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rhombus": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "--package", "rhombus-node-mcp", "mcp-server-rhombus"],
      "env": {
        "RHOMBUS_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can access the file using:

```bash
vim ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

### Step 3: Take It For A Spin! 🎡

Time to see the magic happen! Let's verify that Claude for Desktop is detecting our awesome `rhombus` server tools:

1. Look for the powerful hammer icon in Claude's interface ⚒️
2. Click it to reveal your new arsenal of tools
3. Spot the Filesystem MCP Server tools in the list

If they're visible, YOU'VE DONE IT! 🎉 Your integration is live and ready to rock! Claude can now communicate directly with Rhombus systems, giving you the same incredible capabilities as the Rhombus web app, but with the added power of Claude's intelligence!

## 🚀 Running Locally: Unleash Your Inner Developer!

Want to get hands-on and test out the Rhombus MCP server right on your machine? Follow these steps to build and run a local Docker image, then connect it to your MCP client of choice!

### 1. Build Your Local Docker Image 🛠️
First, let's get that Docker image built. This will allow you to run the MCP server in a local environment.

```bash
npm install
docker build -t mcp-server-rhombus .
```

### 2. Update Your Claude Config for Local Use ⚡
Now, you'll need to adjust your `claude_desktop_config.json` to point to your newly built local Docker image.

> ***Note:*** When running locally, the Docker image name changes to `mcp-server-rhombus` from `rhombussystems/mcp-server-rhombus`. Make sure to update this in your configuration!

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rhombus": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "RHOMBUS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
        "mcp-server-rhombus"
      ],
      "env": {
        "RHOMBUS_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating a new tool
